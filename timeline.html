description: Events leading to colonization of the Moon, steps taken for profitable lunar industry, and the foundation of a lunar society.
headline: Timeline to a Lunar Society
intro: What matters is understanding what <i>needs</i> to happen, and what <i>can</i> happen. Then if people feel it is a goal worth pursuing, it happens. This page explains the best conceivable path if that will is there and pushes aside conflict politics. In that situation, from when the first mission launches, it would take about 50 years to get to the part called Birth of Worlds. <br><br>The path uses known technology, and a reasonable pace of development. Starting 25 years in, it assumes AI has advanced enough that robots can do complex work without supervision, and 35 years in, that good carbon nanotube cable is available on industrial scales. Those assumptions are conservative. <br><br>If we knew what amazing things we could achieve if only we worked together, perhaps we'd find the will to do so. What follows shows a world like that.
