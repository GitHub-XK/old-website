title: Timeline for Lunar Colonization
description: Events leading to colonization of the Moon, steps taken for profitable lunar industry, and the foundation of a lunar society.
headline: The Path to a Lunar Society
intro: What matters is understanding what <i>needs</i> to happen, and what <i>can</i> happen. The dates aren't important. Nothing determines the dates more than the priority the people of the space-faring nations place on this goal. This page explains the best conceivable path if the will is there and the politics of conflict is set aside. If we were really aware of what amazing things we could achieve if only we worked together, perhaps we would find the will to do so. Take what follows as an illustration of what that could be.

  <h1>Transport Systems</h1>
  <details>
  <summary>The key to success</summary>
   <p>
    Europeans colonized the world thanks to their great sailing ships. Railroads were vital to expansion across the North American continent. Almost any level of investment is justfied if it secures you access long-term to a large enough place. When that new place is the rest of the solar system? Bet the bank on it.
    The difference between reliance on chemical rockets and reliance on the system below is like the difference between wagon trains and steam locomotives. Railroads completely changed what was possible, this is the same thing.
   </p>
   <p>The cost of transport is currently a high percentage of the total cost of space missions. Total loss of missions due to launch failure, engine failure in space, or landing failure is frequent. Long delays due to the time it takes to prepare and launch rockets slows everything down. Any serious undertaking in space needs to address these issues before it does anything else. The road to profitability can be made much shorter thanks to proper design here.

  <h1>Colony Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>Go big, go robotic</summary>
   <p>
    Our position is it doesn't make sense to undertake construction or any industrial process on the Moon unless it can be done by robots that are operated remotely. Also, once a base is being built of lunar materials, it should be as big as possible. Most things should be made as large as they reasonably can be, until transport between Earth and the Moon has become routine and the colonies are very well established. Redundancy and extra capacity tend to come in handy at an outpost. The kind of businesses the colony will pursue first also tend to benefit from economies of scale - real estate, heavy machinery manufacture, facilities for tourism, sports, and broadcasting.

  <h1>Socio-Economic Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>A bridge to a new era</summary>
   <p>Everything here is predicated on the idea that a group of nations decide together to colonize the Moon and devote the funds necessary to do so properly without question. So, let the model be that the first missions are funded and carried out jointly by the nations with well-established space agencies - the United States, Russia, the European Union, China, India, Japan, and Canada. Once the Residence Program (explained below) begins, all nations participate.

  <h5><a href="machines2.html#AsteroidAnchors">First Asteroid Retrieval Mission</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Based on the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/depssite/documents/webpage/deps_083266.pdf">ARM</a> mission design scaled by a factor of 10, aiming for an asteroid massing 7.5 metric kilotons</li>
   <li>This needs to launch first so it can get the asteroid to lunar orbit by the time the infrastructure to do something with it is ready.</li>
   <li>This asteroid will be the anchor for the first tether from lunar orbit to the lunar surface. Want a good reason to conduct the ARM mission? This is it.</li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#ionDrive">Ion Drive Asteroid Retrieval Ship</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>This will require on-orbit assembly due to the size of the solar panels and the scale of the bag that will enclose the asteroid. It can probably be done in 2 pieces.
   </li>
   <li>To work well its solar panels need to generate roughly 1 MW of power, and it needs an array of <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040139476.pdf">HiPEP ion drives</a>, The ISS panels generate about 100 KW, so 10 times that much. One might hope to get 15 N of thrust from such a system. </li>
   <li>The ship is reused to retrieve a series of asteroids over time. It may need some refurbishment but should be able to get the 5 asteroids for the complete lunar tether system, and then a bunch of asteroids for mining.</li>
 </ul>
  <h5><a href="machines2.html#nuclearShuttles">Nuclear Thermal Shuttles</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Flies between the lunar surface and lunar orbit</li>
   <li>May be practical to connect its engines to turbine generators when not flying</li>
   <li>Uses an <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#lantr">oxygen 'afterburner'</a> to increase thrust during launch and landing</li>
   <li>A barrier needs to be between the shuttle and human habs so that people aren't exposed to its radiation when working outside</li>
   <li>To design the model, better data is needed on radiation shield design. </li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#CargoShip">Cargo Ship from LEO to LLO</a></h5>
 <ul>
  <li>uses next generation hydrolox upper stages capable of many restarts</li>
  <li>On the LEO end, it meets a space station, loads the cargo waiting there and gets servicing</li>
  <li>On the LLO end, it hands off its load to the nuclear shuttle</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>10 to 15 missions occur during this phase. The cargo ship takes payloads of up to 40 tons, the nuclear shuttle can land up to 12 tons on the surface.</b></p>
 </article>
 <article class="column">
  <h5><a href="machines.html#robots">Robot and Rover Test Missions</a></h5>
<p>These can't start until the cargo ship and shuttle are running and have delivered their first payload to the site of the future base. The goal would be to have robotic machinery on the surface capable of performing the complex work of construction and volatile extraction by the time the asteroid for the first tether arrives in orbit.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>After the cargo ship has deployed the nuclear shuttle, and the two have taken the first deliveries of equipment and supplies to the base site on the rim of Peary crater, a crew is delivered to orbit by a conventional rocket. Their capsule is picked up by the nuclear shuttle and landed at the base site.
  </li>
  <li>Remotely operated equipment has already excavated a trench, placed an inflatable hab for the crew in it, and covered it over with enough regolith to form a good radiation barrier. If there were problems with this process, the human crew completes it. Other simple processes such as basic scouting and solar panel setup are done. </li>
  <li>Also the surface regolith is fused using simple Fresnel lenses. The thin layer created will tend to break up and shift, but by driving a grid of fused regolith stakes into the ground before passing the lens over an area, the melted surface fuses with the stakes into one piece. The cracking then doesn't lead to shifting. Thickening the fused layer by spreading more regolith overtop and heating it can also be done.
  </li>
  <li>The crew spends a few weeks on site:
   <ul>
    <li>Surveying the locale, doing experiments on the soil and samples from the permanently shadowed craters</li>
    <li>Testing the prototype robots that will be used for more complex remote work after the crew leaves, and setting up initial infrastructure for them, such as rails they move on, bases for arms, stations for basic repairs and installaation of drop-in replacement parts.</li>
    <li>Assisting the remote operation equipment in the initial micro-charge excavation for the first constructed hab, and the initial testing of fabrication of building materials from melted regolith</li>
    <li>After the crew leave, a further series of missions uses that infrastructure so improved robots can be tested and do work.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One or two additional crew expeditions may be sent if needed to complete the design and testing of the robotic equipment. The robots must be capable of doing all the complex tasks of construction, excavation, extraction of volatile ices, and miscellaneous duties, by remote operation from Earth. The emphasis is very much on the creation of equipment that can do that work without people on site. Further missions to that end would also be of relatively short duration, on the order of a few weeks.</li>
  <li>Note that construction relies principally on the use of melted regolith construction materials, joined using more melted regolith. It does not require precision or complex tools. It does require simple tools that can handle temperatures in the range of 1200 to 1400 &deg;C, and robot limbs that can withstand the occasional splash or drip. The <a href="machines.html#MIPstation">MIP stations</a> are deployed from the very beginning and are very simple systems, they are the key to the feasibility of this.
  </li>
  <li>Note also that excavation is done in two steps that are simple and very effective. First, by boring a grid of holes using a sun gun, a piece whose model in in process right now. It is based very closely on the work of <a href="http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/VG09-193.pdf">Nakamura and Smith</a> through Physical Sciences Inc. Second, by laying micro-charges in those holes and detonating them to <a href="https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=rOg6B38bunIC&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=explosives+regolith&source=bl&ots=0YL6xrfyup&sig=d_DOCyBJTkkGCfuNIe4VsSQ0esY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhl-nZkazSAhUGllQKHRoDDUgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=explosives%20regolith&f=false">loosen the soil</a>. Further depth is achieved by repeating this process.

  <h5>Creation of an international space agency body</h5>
  <p>The agencies of most of the major space-faring nations cooperated in the construction of the International Space Station: ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos, NASA, and CSA. This is the best precedent but is a minor collaboration compared to what would be involved in settling the Moon.</p>
  <p>Many questions of jurisdiction, ownership, information sharing, and legal responsibility would need to be settled. Again the agreements covering the ISS are the model that would need to be built on.</p>
  <p>A shift to an open-source model regarding the technology developed for the project could reduce tensions on several of those issues. The application of international law might help in questions of  administration.</p>
  <p>As the project would be underway for a number of years before it involved a permanent human settlement, and a number of years more before there was profit, the scale of cooperation needed to continue working together would only slowly need to grow, and be tested many times before issues of serious consequence needed to be settled.</p>
  <p>For this reason, such an endeavor provides the ideal way to develop the broad international collaboration needed to address long-term peace and prosperity on Earth.</p>

  <h5><a href="machines2.html#TetherTransport">Vertical Tether Construction in Polar Orbit</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>An asteroid massing 7500 tons is brought into high polar orbit, 5000 km above the surface. Surveys of Near Earth Asteroids will be much more complete by then, so it is reasonable to expect a carbonaceous asteroid that is suitable will have been found and collected. Its content of carbon and metal would be its most valuable contribution, as water is being mined from the lunar pole at less expense. But its hydrated minerals are still of value.</li>
   <li>Zylon cables, construction equipment, and a test cable car are brought from Earth to the asteroid. Some small scale tests will already have been done in preparation. Now further testing and experimentation is done to ensure a robust design.</li>
   <li>A tether begins to be extended from the asteroid towards the surface. The first increment is only a few kilometers, then increments of a hundred kilometers are added. The platform at the foot, the procedure by which the nuclear shuttle meets it and is grappled, oscillation control on the tether, the cable car, and cable car propulsion are all thoroughly tested at this scale and further refined.</li>
   <li>The tether is extended in increments of 1000 km until it reaches an altitude of 100 km above the surface. The lower tether is then complete.</li>
   <li>The cable car may receive power beamed from the asteroid's solar panels, or may have an onboard nuclear generator.</li>
   <li>Once at its full length, the nuclear shuttle will only need to use 1/5th of the delta V needed to reach and return from lunar orbit to reach the platform of the tether foot and return. It will need that same 1/5th of the normal delta V to go anywhere on the Moon by grappling the platform and hanging off it until it is over its destination, and to return to base the same way.</li>
   <li>Conversion of the asteroid to a space station begins. Early steps in that direction were carried out during tether construction, replacing payloads of asteroid material with simple vessels and beams made of fused regolith. The solar panels and engines of the retrieval ship are installed on the asteroid for use in orbital maintenance.</li>
   <li>The upper tether, extending outwards deeper into space, is also installed and given its own cable car and platform at the tip. This will proceed much faster as the dynamics of the system and good designs are now known.</li>
   <li>With this process completed, it takes about 2 km/s less delta V to get something to the Moon from Earth, and 3 km/s less to get something back.</li>
   <li>The mining of ice from the poles now is used to fuel the cargo ship on the Earth/Moon run completely.</li>
  </ul>
<p>A second asteroid retrieval mission is sent out from Earth to get the anchor mass for the equatorial tether complex. Target mass: 25 kilotons.</p>
<p>Cargo runs between LEO and the polar tether occur at every opportunity, every 2 weeks, 26 per year.</p>
 </article>
 <article class="column">
  <h5><a href="colonies.html#PearyModels">Completion of the Peary First Hab</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>The simple boards, beams, panels and such that the MIP stations can produce are sufficient for the bulk of this hab, without needing cables or fiber reinforcement. They can also be used to produce simple furnishings (tables, shelves, doors, chairs, beds ...) and simple implements (jugs, cups, bowls, boxes, shovels, rakes...) </li>
   <li>Everything else must be brought from Earth - the roof membrane, all the machinery and internal systems.</li>
   <li>Once the hab has been pressurized and all the systems successfully tested, the first permanent crew arrives - 30 people. They all have an initial commitment of 2 years after which they may be rotated out for someone else, but the staff will remain 30 people and ramp up as further installations come online.</li>
   <li>This crew concentrates on the development of industrial and farming capacity. They are able to accomplish a great deal quickly, because the teleoperation of the robotic equipment continues to be done from Earth, which they augment now with onsite remote operation of such equipment. Being onsite to handle problems, modify and upgrade equipment, and invent new processes, they are able to make the robotic equipment extremely productive. The robots become able to execute complex processes almost independently, and begin to produce many of the components needed to make more robots.</li>
   <li>Once they complete the first greenhouse, stabilize ice harvesting at a suitable level,   complete the first solar thermal power plant, add a second, much larger hab, and meet a set of test goals demonstrating that it is safe to expand the population, the Residence Program begins</li>
   <li>Due to the great significance of the first permanent habitat on another celestial body, the first completed hab is simply called First Hab. The second hab, for the first round of the RP, needs a name, as does the polar colony, the polar tether, and a number of other major installations being planned. This task will require consultation.</li>
  </ul>
 </article>
 <article class="column">
  <h5>The Residence Program Begins</h5>
  <p>This is actually the final step of this phase, happening after everything in the other columns is done. However, preparation has been happening for years.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The 2nd Peary hab (connected to First Hab) houses the first 200 astronauts of the program. Each is a married couple selected by their countries to go to the Moon permanently - to live out the rest of their lives there. For this privilege, these nations pay $150 million per astronaut. All astronauts must meet stiff criteria agreed upon by all the nations.
   <ul>
    <li>They must be a married couple with no children under the age of 18, married at least 10 years, and at least 40 years of age. </li>
    <li>They must be scientists and engineers who can play an active role in studying and developing the Moon. Minimum qualification is that both have at least a bachelor's degree in the sciences or engineering, an one has a more advanced degree or a professional career in a relevant area.</li>
    <li>They must participate regularly in programming broadcast back to Earth, both by appearing on camera, and by coming up with content for such programming. There are many options - arts, sports, educational content, conversational content, games. Ability in an art or a sport will be part of the criteria by which they are selected.</li>
    <li>They must donate their bodies to science upon death.</li>
    <li>As it is so important, might as well just say that they all must have had a vasectomy or a tubal ligation</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   <li>Nations may send a number of representatives, but at the same time, there is a deliberate effort to send a group that truly represents all the races, religions, language groups, regions, and ways of life of humanity.</li>
   <li>The crew of First Hab come from the main space-faring nations who built it. As the Residence Program is the main initial revenue stream, it is made of people from other nations. There is overlap due to, for instance, the many nations of the European Union wishing to have nationals in the settlement, as only a few would have nationals in the First Hab. Other space-faring nations may also forego recuperation of their investment in order to have more citizens on the Moon. Still, the bulk of the people in RP round 1 come from places other than the European Union, the U.S.A., Russia, China, India, Japan, and Canada.</li>
   <li>Payment for each spot may be made over 5 years. Today, there are 63 countries in the world with annual national budgets over US$30 billion. Examples of countries at that US$30 billion level include Slovakia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Luxembourg. By the time the program began there would be a number of others.</li>
   <li>Most of the astronauts would probably be in their mid-40s. They would probably be able to actively participate in colony life for at least 30 years. So, those countries in the list in the point above, for an annual investment of 0.1% of the national budget, would get 2 national superstars on the Moon, that can do way more to inspire national pride and collective interest in science and progress than anything they could do at home, for 30 or 40 years.</li>
  </ul>
   <p>There will be 7 rounds to this program. The second one goes partly to Peary, and partly to Lalande. The table shows the main aspects of each round.</p>

  <h5>The Residence Program - Basic structure and rules</h5>
  <p>A lot happens during the course of the 7 rounds of the RP. By the time the last round is complete, Lalande and Peary have both reached the full extent shown in Phase 1 of the virtual colonies. Although the residents must qualify, and sign a contract stipulating their duties and obligations, they are free to pursue their own projects as time permits. In later rounds residents will have more free time and greater discretion to pursue activities aside from their official duties on the colony.</p>

    <h5>Asteroid for Equatorial Tether arrives in orbit</h5>
    <p>
    This is going to be the real transport hub for the Moon, together with Cernan's Promise, and later Lalande City. It develops into a colony in its own right. It is another carbonaceous asteroid, this time massing 25 metric kilotons. It is placed in a circular orbit 5000 km above the surface, so that it has the same orbital period as the polar tether and they will never be at risk of collision.
    </p>

    A moonward and spaceward tether just like the ones on the polar tether are built outwards from the asteroid. These will be reinforced to take bigger payloads over time, and even to run multiple cars up and down.

    The First Hab crew and the astronauts of the RP build more infrastructure at Peary. More robotic equipment arrives from Earth to assist, including prototype 3d printers, reactors for chemical processing, and more advanced robots and rovers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expand ice mining, separating out different ice chemicals</li>
      <li>Investigate processing to produce quartz glass, and glass fibers suitable for use as reinforcement in a fused regolith matrix</li>
      <li>Expand the greenhouses with the goal of producing most of the residents' food on-site. Begin raising edible insects as a source of quality protein and fat. If that goes well, most calories could come from local food, though it could take time to have yields sufficient for the local population.</li>
      <li>Expand the solar thermal plant's capacity to serve all local power needs and provide a source of molten regolith for reactors and construction. It should be possible to produce a good fraction of this structure on-site.</li>
      <li>Build a telescope in a small crater - a fixed one in which the whole crater is simply lined with a mirror.</li>

    <h5>The Equatorial Tether becomes Gagarin Station</h5>
    <p>
    The asteroid is mined, and as material from it is sent down to Cernan's Promise, components for a space station are sent back up, plus gravel and rocks to maintain or increase its mass. This space station will expand over time to fill certain economic niches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Microgravity manufacturing: with the Moon colonies there to send up raw materials and manufactured items, the asteroid is a good place for this. Perhaps if lunar material can be used to produce cheap enough heat shields, it would even be possible to send such goods to Earth's surface within a budget that made sense, by releasing them from the upper tether on a trajectory that will skim Earth's atmosphere. </li>
      <li>Staging area for deep-space missions: As the manufacturing of space infrastructure grows as an industry at Cernan's Promise, it could prove valuable to assemble the final ship and payload for many deep-space missions there. Only the things that can't be produced on the Moon would need to come from Earth. Once ready, the ship can be given a significant speed boost by the upper launcher, allowing it to get quickly on its way.</li>
      <li>Shipyard: Extending the previous idea, final assembly and outfitting of components from Cernan's Promise would be done at the asteroid. Complete ships combining those components with ones from Earth would be produced. Some would be nuclear ships. Some would be solar sail ships. Both kinds of ships would gain even more advantage than other designs through launch-release from the upper tether. Nuclear ships can avoid firing engines where the radiation spray could damage installations on the asteroid surface, solar sails save a ton of time by avoiding the need to break orbit themselves. </li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article class="column">
    <h5>Construction of Cernan's Promise</h5>
    <p>As heavy industry will be concentrated at Cernan's Promise, once begun the priority is to get production going there as quickly as possible.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The initial hab is first built, where the local administration will be lodged, similar to the role of First Hab. That construction includes paving the surrounding area (which means fusing the surface into stone), a provisional spaceport where the nuclear shuttle's engine is  connected up to serve as a generator during construction, a set of MIP stations, and an initial basalt fiber production facility specializing in cable. It is designed for a staff of 40 people. Once completed, that staff takes up residence and oversees further construction.</li>
      <li>Roughly in order, the following infrastructure is built (here the roughness of the plan is more apparent than usual - this will be refined):
      <ol>
        <li>Solar thermal power plant (TESS phase 1), full-scale basalt fiber production unit, initial industrial hangar with first dust-roasters, vacuum deposition furnace, 3d printers, and cryogenic storage area </li>
        <li>Big atrium, gallery (phase 1), beginning of glass production, first fluidized bed reactors</li>
        <li>Large hangar with minimal atmosphere, 2nd standard hangar, TESS phase 2, first sports hab, extend upper gallery, south long atrium, proper spaceport</li>
        <li>Complete upper gallery, 2nd TESS on hilltop, south hangar cluster, north long atrium </li>
        <li>Teacup crater, lower gallery with sports habs and bottom dome</li>
        <li>Mega-atrium</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even as all this is being built, production of other products is also occurring. Components for Gagarin Station are made and shipped out. Efforts are made to build more robots using local resources as much as possible. A few satellites are made and placed in orbit. A hull, frame, trusses, bulk regolith shielding, and a large tank of water, are sent to LEO for a space station.</p>
    <h5>Expansion of Peary Colony</h5>
    <p>As the population grows, more greenhouses are needed. Ice mining also expands, now being done in a whole set of craters. The ice mining is now almost completely automated. The population at Peary levels off at 1000 people, and everyone else goes to Lalande. </p>

    <h5>Residence Program rounds 2 through 5</h5>
    <p>Total population at the completion of these events is 6300 people - 6200 from the RP, and 100 from the space-faring nations who continue to administer the colonies. The Moon Agency is created at this point, and staff is extended beyond the existing management staff from the space agencies to include some of the residents. The MA oversees colony activity beyond that point, following the dictates of a treaty created to establish its policies.</p>
    <p>Some programming broadcast from the colonies becomes quite popular on Earth. Certain sports have evolved into something unique and entertaining, and there are now leagues of small competing teams, and scheduled matches for several sports that include annual championships. A sort of variety talk show has also become very popular. An annual arts event gets considerable attention and includes virtual participation by people on Earth. Many of the video blogs of different resident groups have large loyal followings. The lunar population includes a number of people who have become international celebrities, and even more who are major celebrities in their home countries.</p>
    <h5>The Moon Fund and Opening of the Economy</h5>
    <p>The lunar economy nears break even during these events. The Moon Fund is created and all lunar finances from existing industry then go through it. How profits from that are distributed, once they exist, becomes a very delicate matter that has to be carefully negotiated. Most industries are privatized in stages. Transport infrastructure continues to be held in common and governed by the Moon Agency.</p>
    <p>The residents' needs have been and continue to be covered by the colony administration. All colony resources are essentially held in common, as far as providing for the people there goes. As time goes on, there are increasing numbers of deals between residents for goods and services that are extras. There is barter, and sometimes exchanges of funds between Earth-side accounts, which is then used to have extra luxury items delivered. (Residents already had a standard allotment of mass and money for getting non-essentials from Earth. Common examples included favorite foods, extra clothing, and small furnishings.) Towards the end of this period, the freedom of residents to have contracts with entities on Earth and be paid increases, and the wealth of some residents suddenly increases as a result.</p>

    <h5>Addition of 3 More Polar Tethers</h5>
    <p>The original asteroid retrieval ship, now heavily upgraded, delivers asteroids for the remaining tethers for the Moon. They are placed in staggered polar orbits, one every 90&deg;, and all the tethers have the same orbital period so they will never interfere with each other. All three mass 25 kilotons, like the Gagarin asteroid. One is again carbonaceous, the other two are mostly metal. Mining installations are created on all three, but there is little call for human habitation on them and they have only basic facilities for a small, occasional crew. The mining and transport work is overseen remotely and is largely automatic.</p>
    <p>With this system complete, the maximum wait between convenient trajectories to or from a tether is 3.5 days anywhere on the Moon. With a reasonable fuel penalty, most places are accessible much more regularly. In a pinch a rescue crew can get anywhere in a few hours using the shuttles alone. So, now ice mining starts at the south pole as well, and many other places on the Moon are explored more extensively. In a few places, valuable ores, or very large lava tubes, or some especially exciting discovery is found, and expeditions begin development or exploration there.</p>
    <h5>Coil Gun Use Begins</h5>
    <p>Cernan's Promise starts using coil guns to launch cargo to the foot of Gagarin's tether, or straight into orbit or on a trajectory for LEO. These launches are in capsules that have thrusters sufficient for course corrections or orbital maneuvers, and most are reusable. Some can also be decelerated by a catcher with a similar structure on return, that system is made after the initial coil gun.</p>
    <p>Lalande B, at 8 km across and about 30 km north of Lalande, is used for this purpose. All spaceport activity is transferred there over time to provide a buffer zone between it and Lalande City. It also has  an even shape and smooth walls so the coil guns over time can be made longer, and to swivel on a track around the crater rim in order to launch or catch in any direction.</p>
    <h5>Earth Orbital Tether Work Begins</h5>
    <p>Another jump up in mass moved, the asteroid delivered to be the anchor mass is 1 metric megaton of material, largely metallic. Enough confidence in asteroid maneuvering and tether technology has built up to place it in orbit and begin the tether. Initially its orbit is circularized at 5000 km altitude, and the tether is built earthwards to an altitude of 250 km. </p>
    <p>In order for this to work, a program to shift satellites to orbits that don't interfere with the tether is undertaken, starting a number of years before the anchor asteroid arrives. Many are shifted to below 250 km, and the incentive is that the tether complex will service and refuel these satellites for an excellent price. Other favored orbits are ones at the final orbital altitude of the anchor at 10 000 km, either moving with it or in a clear harmonic, or ones beyond its tip, which will be at 15 000 km. Satellites that really can't be adapted to any of these options are maintained by the achor station's servicing fleet anyways, which helps maintain its orbit clear of obstructions. But of course the tether must be constantly maintained, be designed to withstand large impacts, and be able to defend itself if a collision is anticipated.</p>
    <p>At this altitude, the velocity needed to meet the foot is decreased to 5.5 km/s.</p>
