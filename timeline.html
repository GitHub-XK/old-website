title: Timeline for Lunar Colonization
description: Events leading to colonization of the Moon, steps taken for profitable lunar industry, and the foundation of a lunar society.
headline: The Path to a Lunar Society
intro: What matters is understanding what <i>needs</i> to happen, and what <i>can</i> happen. The dates aren't important. Nothing determines the dates more than the priority the people of the space-faring nations place on this goal. This page explains the best conceivable path if the will is there and the politics of conflict is set aside. If we were really aware of what amazing things we could achieve if only we worked together, perhaps we would find the will to do so. Take what follows as an illustration of what that could be.

  <h1>Transport Systems</h1>
  <details>
  <summary>The key to success</summary>
   <p>
    Europeans colonized the world thanks to their great sailing ships. Railroads were vital to expansion across the North American continent. Almost any level of investment is justfied if it secures you access long-term to a large enough place. When that new place is the rest of the solar system? Bet the bank on it.
    The difference between reliance on chemical rockets and reliance on the system below is like the difference between wagon trains and steam locomotives. Railroads completely changed what was possible, this is the same thing.
   </p>
   <p>The cost of transport is currently a high percentage of the total cost of space missions. Total loss of missions due to launch failure, engine failure in space, or landing failure is frequent. Long delays due to the time it takes to prepare and launch rockets slows everything down. Any serious undertaking in space needs to address these issues before it does anything else. The road to profitability can be made much shorter thanks to proper design here.

  <h1>Colony Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>Go big, go robotic</summary>
   <p>
    Our position is it doesn't make sense to undertake construction or any industrial process on the Moon unless it can be done by robots that are operated remotely. Also, once a base is being built of lunar materials, it should be as big as possible. Most things should be made as large as they reasonably can be, until transport between Earth and the Moon has become routine and the colonies are very well established. Redundancy and extra capacity tend to come in handy at an outpost. The kind of businesses the colony will pursue first also tend to benefit from economies of scale - real estate, heavy machinery manufacture, facilities for tourism, sports, and broadcasting.

  <h1>Socio-Economic Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>A bridge to a new era</summary>
   <p>Everything here is predicated on the idea that a group of nations decide together to colonize the Moon and devote the funds necessary to do so properly without question. So, let the model be that the first missions are funded and carried out jointly by the nations with well-established space agencies - the United States, Russia, the European Union, China, India, Japan, and Canada. Once the Residence Program (explained below) begins, all nations participate.

  <h5><a href="machines2.html#AsteroidAnchors">First Asteroid Retrieval Mission</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Based on the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/depssite/documents/webpage/deps_083266.pdf">ARM</a> mission design scaled by a factor of 10, aiming for an asteroid massing 7.5 metric kilotons</li>
   <li>This needs to launch first so it can get the asteroid to lunar orbit by the time the infrastructure to do something with it is ready.</li>
   <li>This asteroid will be the anchor for the first tether from lunar orbit to the lunar surface. Want a good reason to conduct the ARM mission? This is it.</li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#ionDrive">Ion Drive Asteroid Retrieval Ship</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>This will require on-orbit assembly due to the size of the solar panels and the scale of the bag that will enclose the asteroid. It can probably be done in 2 pieces.
   </li>
   <li>To work well its solar panels need to generate roughly 1 MW of power, and it needs an array of <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040139476.pdf">HiPEP ion drives</a>, The ISS panels generate about 100 KW, so 10 times that much. One might hope to get 15 N of thrust from such a system. </li>
   <li>The ship is reused to retrieve a series of asteroids over time. It may need some refurbishment but should be able to get the 5 asteroids for the complete lunar tether system, and then a bunch of asteroids for mining.</li>
 </ul>
  <h5><a href="machines2.html#nuclearShuttles">Nuclear Thermal Shuttles</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Flies between the lunar surface and lunar orbit</li>
   <li>May be practical to connect its engines to turbine generators when not flying</li>
   <li>Uses an <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#lantr">oxygen 'afterburner'</a> to increase thrust during launch and landing</li>
   <li>A barrier needs to be between the shuttle and human habs so that people aren't exposed to its radiation when working outside</li>
   <li>To design the model, better data is needed on radiation shield design. </li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#CargoShip">Cargo Ship from LEO to LLO</a></h5>
 <ul>
  <li>uses next generation hydrolox upper stages capable of many restarts</li>
  <li>On the LEO end, it meets a space station, loads the cargo waiting there and gets servicing</li>
  <li>On the LLO end, it hands off its load to the nuclear shuttle</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>10 to 15 missions occur during this phase. The cargo ship takes payloads of up to 40 tons, the nuclear shuttle can land up to 12 tons on the surface.</b></p>
 </article>
 <article class="column">
  <h5><a href="machines.html#robots">Robot and Rover Test Missions</a></h5>
<p>These can't start until the cargo ship and shuttle are running and have delivered their first payload to the site of the future base. The goal would be to have robotic machinery on the surface capable of performing the complex work of construction and volatile extraction by the time the asteroid for the first tether arrives in orbit.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>After the cargo ship has deployed the nuclear shuttle, and the two have taken the first deliveries of equipment and supplies to the base site on the rim of Peary crater, a crew is delivered to orbit by a conventional rocket. Their capsule is picked up by the nuclear shuttle and landed at the base site.
  </li>
  <li>Remotely operated equipment has already excavated a trench, placed an inflatable hab for the crew in it, and covered it over with enough regolith to form a good radiation barrier. If there were problems with this process, the human crew completes it. Other simple processes such as basic scouting and solar panel setup are done. </li>
  <li>Also the surface regolith is fused using simple Fresnel lenses. The thin layer created will tend to break up and shift, but by driving a grid of fused regolith stakes into the ground before passing the lens over an area, the melted surface fuses with the stakes into one piece. The cracking then doesn't lead to shifting. Thickening the fused layer by spreading more regolith overtop and heating it can also be done.
  </li>
  <li>The crew spends a few weeks on site:
   <ul>
    <li>Surveying the locale, doing experiments on the soil and samples from the permanently shadowed craters</li>
    <li>Testing the prototype robots that will be used for more complex remote work after the crew leaves, and setting up initial infrastructure for them, such as rails they move on, bases for arms, stations for basic repairs and installaation of drop-in replacement parts.</li>
    <li>Assisting the remote operation equipment in the initial micro-charge excavation for the first constructed hab, and the initial testing of fabrication of building materials from melted regolith</li>
    <li>After the crew leave, a further series of missions uses that infrastructure so improved robots can be tested and do work.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One or two additional crew expeditions may be sent if needed to complete the design and testing of the robotic equipment. The robots must be capable of doing all the complex tasks of construction, excavation, extraction of volatile ices, and miscellaneous duties, by remote operation from Earth. The emphasis is very much on the creation of equipment that can do that work without people on site. Further missions to that end would also be of relatively short duration, on the order of a few weeks.</li>
  <li>Note that construction relies principally on the use of melted regolith construction materials, joined using more melted regolith. It does not require precision or complex tools. It does require simple tools that can handle temperatures in the range of 1200 to 1400 &deg;C, and robot limbs that can withstand the occasional splash or drip. The <a href="machines.html#MIPstation">MIP stations</a> are deployed from the very beginning and are very simple systems, they are the key to the feasibility of this.
  </li>
  <li>Note also that excavation is done in two steps that are simple and very effective. First, by boring a grid of holes using a sun gun, a piece whose model in in process right now. It is based very closely on the work of <a href="http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/VG09-193.pdf">Nakamura and Smith</a> through Physical Sciences Inc. Second, by laying micro-charges in those holes and detonating them to <a href="https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=rOg6B38bunIC&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=explosives+regolith&source=bl&ots=0YL6xrfyup&sig=d_DOCyBJTkkGCfuNIe4VsSQ0esY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhl-nZkazSAhUGllQKHRoDDUgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=explosives%20regolith&f=false">loosen the soil</a>. Further depth is achieved by repeating this process.
  </li>

  <h5>Creation of an international space agency body</h5>
  <p>The agencies of most of the major space-faring nations cooperated in the construction of the International Space Station: ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos, NASA, and CSA. This is the best precedent but is a minor collaboration compared to what would be involved in settling the Moon.</p>
  <p>Many questions of jurisdiction, ownership, information sharing, and legal responsibility would need to be settled. Again the agreements covering the ISS are the model that would need to be built on.</p>
  <p>A shift to an open-source model regarding the technology developed for the project could reduce tensions on several of those issues. The application of international law might help in questions of  administration.</p>
  <p>As the project would be underway for a number of years before it involved a permanent human settlement, and a number of years more before there was profit, the scale of cooperation needed to continue working together would only slowly need to grow, and be tested many times before issues of serious consequence needed to be settled.</p>
  <p>For this reason, such an endeavor provides the ideal way to develop the broad international collaboration needed to address long-term peace and prosperity on Earth.</p>

  <h5><a href="machines2.html#TetherTransport">Vertical Tether Construction in Polar Orbit</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>An asteroid massing 7500 tons is brought into high polar orbit, 5000 km above the surface. Surveys of Near Earth Asteroids will be much more complete by then, so it is reasonable to expect a carbonaceous asteroid that is suitable will have been found and collected. Its content of carbon and metal would be its most valuable contribution, as water is being mined from the lunar pole at less expense. But its hydrated minerals are still of value.</li>
   <li>Zylon cables, construction equipment, and a test cable car are brought from Earth to the asteroid. Some small scale tests will already have been done in preparation. Now further testing and experimentation is done to ensure a robust design.</li>
   <li>A tether begins to be extended from the asteroid towards the surface. The first increment is only a few kilometers, then increments of a hundred kilometers are added. The platform at the foot, the procedure by which the nuclear shuttle meets it and is grappled, oscillation control on the tether, the cable car, and cable car propulsion are all thoroughly tested at this scale and further refined.</li>
   <li>The tether is extended in increments of 1000 km until it reaches an altitude of 100 km above the surface. The lower tether is then complete.</li>
   <li>The cable car may receive power beamed from the asteroid's solar panels, or may have an onboard nuclear generator.</li>
   <li>Once at its full length, the nuclear shuttle will only need to use 1/5th of the delta V needed to reach and return from lunar orbit to reach the platform of the tether foot and return. It will need that same 1/5th of the normal delta V to go anywhere on the Moon by grappling the platform and hanging off it until it is over its destination, and to return to base the same way.</li>
   <li>Conversion of the asteroid to a space station begins. Early steps in that direction were carried out during tether construction, replacing payloads of asteroid material with simple vessels and beams made of fused regolith. The solar panels and engines of the retrieval ship are installed on the asteroid for use in orbital maintenance.</li>
   <li>The upper tether, extending outwards deeper into space, is also installed and given its own cable car and platform at the tip. This will proceed much faster as the dynamics of the system and good designs are now known.</li>
   <li>With this process completed, it takes about 2 km/s less delta V to get something to the Moon from Earth, and 3 km/s less to get something back.</li>
   <li>The mining of ice from the poles now is used to fuel the cargo ship on the Earth/Moon run completely.</li>
  </ul>
<p>A second asteroid retrieval mission is sent out from Earth to get the anchor mass for the equatorial tether complex. Target mass: 15 kilotons.</p>
<p>Cargo runs between LEO and the polar tether occur at every opportunity, every 2 weeks, 26 per year.</p>

 <article class="column">
  <h5><a href="colonies.html#PearyModels">Completion of the Peary First Hab</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>The simple boards, beams, panels and such that the MIP stations can produce are sufficient for the bulk of this hab, without needing cables or fiber reinforcement. They can also be used to produce simple furnishings (tables, shelves, doors, chairs, beds ...) and simple implements (jugs, cups, bowls, boxes, shovels, rakes...) </li>
   <li>Everything else must be brought from Earth - the roof membrane, all the machinery and internal systems.</li>
   <li>Once the hab has been pressurized and all the systems successfully tested, the first permanent crew arrives - 30 people. They all have an initial commitment of 2 years after which they may be rotated out for someone else, but the staff will remain 30 people and ramp up as further installations come online.</li>
   <li>This crew concentrates on the development of industrial and farming capacity. They are able to accomplish a great deal quickly, because the teleoperation of the robotic equipment continues to be done from Earth, which they augment now with onsite remote operation of such equipment. Being onsite to handle problems, modify and upgrade equipment, and invent new processes, they are able to make the robotic equipment extremely productive. The robots become able to execute complex processes almost independently, and begin to produce many of the components needed to make more robots.</li>
   <li>Once they complete the first greenhouse, stabilize ice harvesting at a suitable level,   complete the first solar thermal power plant, add a second, much larger hab, and meet a set of test goals demonstrating that it is safe to expand the population, the Residence Program begins</li>
   <li>Due to the great significance of this hab being that it is the first permanent hab, it is simply being called First Hab.</li>
  </ul>
 </article>
 <article class="column">
  <h5>The Residence Program Begins</h5>
  <p>This is actually the final step of this phase, happening after everything in the other columns is done. However, preparation has been happening for years.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The 2nd Peary hab (connected to First Hab) houses the first 200 astronauts of the program. Each is a married couple selected by their countries to go to the Moon permanently - to live out the rest of their lives there. For this privilege, these nations pay $150 million per astronaut. All astronauts must meet stiff criteria agreed upon by all the nations.
   <ul>
    <li>They must be a married couple with no children under the age of 18, married at least 10 years, and at least 40 years of age. </li>
    <li>They must be scientists and engineers who can play an active role in studying and developing the Moon. Minimum qualification is that both have at least a bachelor's degree in the sciences or engineering, an one has a more advanced degree or a professional career in a relevant area.</li>
    <li>They must participate regularly in programming broadcast back to Earth, both by appearing on camera, and by coming up with content for such programming. There are many options - arts, sports, educational content, conversational content, games. Ability in an art or a sport will be part of the criteria by which they are selected.</li>
    <li>
    <li>They must donate their bodies to science upon death.</li>
    <li>As it is so important, might as well just say that they all must have had a vasectomy or a tubal ligation</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   <li>Nations may send a number of representatives, but at the same time, there is a deliberate effort to send a group that truly represents all the races, religions, language groups, regions, and ways of life of humanity.</li>
   <li>The crew of First Hab come from the main space-faring nations who built it. As the Residence Program is the main initial revenue stream, it is made of people from other nations. There is overlap due to, for instance, the many nations of the European Union wishing to have nationals in the settlement, as only a few would have nationals in the First Hab. Other space-faring nations may also forego recuperation of their investment in order to have more citizens on the Moon. Still, the bulk of the people in RP round 1 come from places other than the European Union, the U.S.A., Russia, China, India, Japan, and Canada.</li>
   <li>Payment for each spot may be made over 5 years. Today, there are 63 countries in the world with annual national budgets over US$30 billion. Examples of countries at that US$30 billion level include Slovakia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Luxembourg. By the time the program began there would be a number of others.</li>
   <li>Most of the astronauts would probably be in their mid-40s. They would probably be able to actively participate in colony life for at least 30 years. So, those countries in the list in the point above, for an annual investment of 0.1% of the national budget, would get 2 national superstars on the Moon, that can do way more to inspire national pride and collective interest in science and progress than anything they could do at home, for 30 or 40 years.</li>
  </ul>
   <p>There will be 7 rounds to this program. The second one goes partly to Peary, and partly to Lalande. The table shows the main aspects of each round.</p>

The child will be carefully monitored and the family will return to Earth if a threat to the child's health is detected. The existence of the Earth orbital tether lowers the cost of transport enough for this to be viable. Research into pregnancy and development of young in higher mammals will have been conducted by this time, informing safety and procedure on the matter. It is assumed that early pregnancy is not affected by lunar conditions, or that fertile colonists can take appropriate steps to ensure safety in an early phase of pregnancy before they return to Earth.</td>
