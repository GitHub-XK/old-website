title: Timeline for Lunar Colonization
description: Events leading to colonization of the Moon, steps taken for profitable lunar industry, and the foundation of a lunar society.
headline: The Path to a Lunar Society
intro: What matters is understanding what <i>needs</i> to happen, and what <i>can</i> happen. The dates aren't important. Nothing determines the dates more than the priority the people of the space-faring nations place on this goal. This page explains the best conceivable path if the will is there and the politics of conflict is set aside. If we were really aware of what amazing things we could achieve if only we worked together, perhaps we would find the will to do so. Take what follows as an illustration of what that could be.

  <h1>Transport Systems</h1>
  <details>
  <summary>The key to success</summary>
   <p>
    Europeans colonized the world thanks to their great sailing ships. Railroads were vital to expansion across the North American continent. Almost any level of investment is justfied if it secures you access long-term to a large enough place. When that new place is the rest of the solar system? Bet the bank on it.
    The difference between reliance on chemical rockets and reliance on the system below is like the difference between wagon trains and steam locomotives. Railroads completely changed what was possible, this is the same thing.
   </p>
   <p>The cost of transport is currently a high percentage of the total cost of space missions. Total loss of missions due to launch failure, engine failure in space, or landing failure is frequent. Long delays due to the time it takes to prepare and launch rockets slow everything down. Any serious undertaking in space needs to address these issues before it does anything else. The road to profitability can be made much shorter thanks to proper design here.

  <h1>Colony Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>Go big, go robotic</summary>
   <p>
    Our position is it doesn't make sense to undertake construction or any industrial process on the Moon unless it can be done by robots that are operated remotely, or that operate themselves. It will be difficult to get this right at first, but once achieved then the slow, grinding, linear growth of projects in space up to now - is gone. In its place is a growth curve steeper than anything we have ever known. So to contemplate the workings of such a system, you might as well model it on the Moon, where there are no immediate and rather alarming questions about the resulting unemployment, or environmental impact, or power shifts, or anything like that. The reason this timeline forecasts such dramatic growth is because the robots make a world of difference. Advances along these lines have been impressive recently. This is a future we have to expect. </p>
    <p>Also, once a base is being built of lunar materials, it should be as big as possible. Most things should be made as large as they reasonably can be, until transport between Earth and the Moon has become routine and the colonies are very well established. Redundancy and extra capacity tend to come in handy at an outpost. The kind of businesses the colony will pursue first also tend to benefit from economies of scale - real estate, heavy machinery manufacture, facilities for tourism, sports, and broadcasting.

  <h1>Socio-Economic Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>A bridge to a new era</summary>
   <p>Everything here is predicated on the idea that a group of nations decide together to colonize the Moon and devote the funds necessary to do so properly without question. So, let the model be that the first missions are funded and carried out jointly by the nations with well-established space agencies - the United States, Russia, the European Union, China, India, Japan, and Canada. Once the Residence Program (explained below) begins, all nations participate.

  <h5><a href="machines2.html#AsteroidAnchors">First Asteroid Retrieval Mission</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Based on the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/depssite/documents/webpage/deps_083266.pdf">ARM</a> mission design scaled by a factor of 10, aiming for an asteroid massing 7.5 metric kilotons</li>
   <li>This needs to launch first so it can get the asteroid to lunar orbit by the time the infrastructure to do something with it is ready.</li>
   <li>This asteroid will be the anchor for the first skyhook from lunar orbit to the lunar surface. Want a good reason to conduct the ARM mission? This is it.</li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#ionDrive">Ion Drive Asteroid Retrieval Ship</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>This will require on-orbit assembly due to the size of the solar panels and the scale of the bag that will enclose the asteroid. It can probably be done in 2 pieces.
   </li>
   <li>To work well its solar panels need to generate roughly 1 MW of power, and it needs an array of <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040139476.pdf">HiPEP ion drives</a>. The ISS panels generate about 100 KW, so 10 times that much. One might hope to get 15 N of thrust from such a system. </li>
   <li>The ship is reused to retrieve a series of asteroids over time. It will need  refurbishment and upgrading over time to get the 5 asteroids for the complete lunar skyhook system, and then the Earth skyhook asteroid.</li>
 </ul>
  <h5><a href="machines2.html#nuclearShuttles">Nuclear Thermal Shuttles</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Flies between the lunar surface and lunar orbit</li>
   <li>May be practical to connect its engines to turbine generators when not flying</li>
   <li>Uses water for a higher-thrust fuel, which is more efficient, once the skyhook is in place, because most of the fuel is for launch and landing, when high thrust is the priority. Thus the base does not need to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, or to store cryogenic hydrogen.</li>
   <li>A barrier needs to be between the shuttle and human habs so that people aren't exposed to its radiation when working outside</li>
   <li>To design the model, better data is needed on radiation shield design. </li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#PodShip">Pod ship from Low Earth Orbit to Medium Lunar Orbit</a></h5>
 <ul>
  <li>uses next generation hydrolox upper stages capable of many restarts</li>
  <li>On the LEO end, it meets a space station, loads the cargo pods waiting there and gets servicing</li>
  <li>On the MLO end, it hands off its load to the nuclear shuttle, and later to the skyhooks</li>
  <li>When crew come, they arrive in pods outfitted for transporting people.</li>
  <li>This ship is almost completely automatic, no pilots.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Expansion of the International Space Station</h5>
  <p>We shall assume the ISS becomes a public-private entity under some arrangement and continues to fly. To handle the LEO end of missions from here out to RP round 5, it needs a lot of upgrading.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An area for on-orbit assembly of the ships listed above. That needs trusses for mooring components, robotic arms for assembly, and a bigger reaction-wheel system to keep the station oriented properly.</li>
    <li>A berthing area for the pod ship, and tanks and infrastructure to refuel it. (Later those tanks can be for the water the pod ship brings from the Moon.)</li>
    <li>A berthing area for the ships filling the fuel tanks that will later fuel the pod ship.</li>
    <li>The on-orbit assembly area can later be used for storage of the cargo pods for the pod ship, and for loading it when it arrives.</li>
    <li>Equipment to crack the water brought from the Moon into hydrogen and oxygen, and then liquify that, so it can then be loaded back onto the pod ship as fuel.</li>
    <li>The crews that are sent will stay mostly in the passenger pods that get loaded on the pod ship, but the station will still need extra life support capacity and one or two large modules for crew quarters.</li>
    <li>All of which implies also some more solar panels, and sundry electo-mechancal infrastructure to support it all.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The cargo pods are delivered by reusable upper stages that get them to the mooring area and then return to Earth, so no berths for them are needed. </p>
  <p><b>10 to 15 missions to the Moon occur during this phase. The pod ship and nuclear shuttle both can take a maximum payload of 40 tons. The payload landed on the Moon is 300 tons or more. </b></p>
 </article>
 <article class="column" id="RobotRoverTests">
  <h5><a href="machines.html#robots">Robot and Rover Test Missions</a></h5>
<p>These can't start until the pod ship and shuttle are running and have delivered their first payload to the site of the future base. The goal would be to have robotic machinery on the surface capable of performing the complex work of construction and volatile extraction by the time the asteroid for the first skyhook arrives in orbit.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><h6>Mission 1</h6> After the pod ship deploys the nuclear shuttle, on the next trip it brings rovers, robots, equipment and supplies. The nuclear shuttle delivers them to the base site on the west rim of Whipple crater. The battery banks of the shuttle (charged from its nuclear reactor), and its robotic arm, are helpful in providing the robots their initial charge and getting the solar cell arrays and microwave power transmitters set up. </li>
  <li><h6>Small initial tasks for robots</h6> The remotely operated equipment excavates a trench, places an inflatable hab for the crew in it, makes arches that cover it, and cover them over with enough regolith to form a good radiation barrier. If there are problems with this process, the human crew can complete it. They also do scouting, testing, and experiments.</li>
  <li><h6>Paving</h6>A rover using simple Fresnel lenses fuses surface regolith near the hab construction site. The thin layer created will tend to break up and shift, but by driving a grid of fused regolith stakes into the ground before passing the lens over an area, the melted surface fuses with the stakes into one piece. The cracking then doesn't lead to shifting. Thickening the fused layer by spreading more regolith overtop and heating it can also be done. </li>
  <li><h6>Mission 2 - with Crew</h6> a crew is delivered to orbit by the pod ship in a crew pod. They are picked up by the nuclear shuttle and landed at the base site.</li>
  <li>The crew spends a few weeks on site:
   <ul>
    <li>Testing and prepping the prototype robots that will be used for more complex remote work after the crew leave, and setting up initial infrastructure for them: rails they move on, bases for arms, anchor points for cables, stations for basic maintenance and repairs or for installing drop-in replacement parts.</li>
    <li>Assisting in the initial melt-boring and micro-charge excavation for the first constructed hab.</li>
    <li>Testing fabrication of building materials out of melted regolith using melt-in-place stations.</li>
    <li>Sending robots into the permanent shadow of Whipple Crater to take measurements, probe the ground, collect samples, and test robot performance in that enviroment.</li>
    <li>Surveying the locale, doing experiments on the soil and samples from the permanently shadowed craters</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h6>Hab Construction</h6>When the crew leave, the robots continue with the construction of the first hab and related infrastructure.</li>
  <li><h6>Extra Crew Missions</h6>One or two additional crew expeditions may be sent if the robots have problems to upgrade, test, and assist them. The robots must be capable of doing all the complex tasks of construction, excavation, extraction of volatile ices, and miscellaneous duties, by remote operation from Earth. The emphasis is very much on the creation of equipment that can do that work without people on site. Further missions to that end would also be of relatively short duration, on the order of a few weeks.</li>
  <li><h6>Melted Regolith Construction Technique</h6>Construction relies on fabricating simple materials by melting tamped soil with lenses at <a href="machines.html#MIPstation">MIP stations</a>, and joining them using more melted regolith. It does not require precision or complex tools. It does require simple tools that can handle temperatures in the range of 1200 to 1400 &deg;C, and robots that can handle the radiated heat and withstand the occasional splash or drip. The MIP stations are deployed in Mission 2 and are very simple systems, they are the key to the feasibility of this.
  </li>
  <li><h6>Melt-Bore and Micro-Charge Excavation</h6>Excavation is done in two steps that are simple and very effective. First, by boring a grid of holes by melting the ground using a sun gun. It is based very closely on the work of <a href="http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/VG09-193.pdf">Nakamura and Smith</a> through Physical Sciences Inc. Second, by laying micro-charges in those holes and detonating them to <a href="https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=rOg6B38bunIC&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=explosives+regolith&source=bl&ots=0YL6xrfyup&sig=d_DOCyBJTkkGCfuNIe4VsSQ0esY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhl-nZkazSAhUGllQKHRoDDUgQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=explosives%20regolith&f=false">loosen the soil</a>. Further depth is achieved by repeating this process.
  </li>
  <li>The loose rocks, gravel, and soil hauled up during excavation are used as fill and feedstock elsewhere.</li>
  </ul>
 </article>
 <article class="column" id="InternationalSpaceAgency">
  <h5>Creation of the International Space Agency</h5>
  <p>The agencies of most of the major space-faring nations cooperated in the construction of the International Space Station: ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos, NASA, and CSA. This is the best precedent but is a minor collaboration compared to what would be involved in settling the Moon.</p>
  <p>So the ISA is created and has its own staff, taken from all the member agencies. The founders are the United States, Russia, China, the European Union, India, Japan, and Canada. The agency creates the overall plan and parcels out the work on it. As the United States remains the country with the largest space industry and the most launch facilities, it is headquartered in Florida not far from Kennedy Space Center. </p>
  <p>Many questions of jurisdiction, ownership, information sharing, and legal responsibility would need to be settled. Again the agreements covering the ISS are the model that would need to be built on.</p>
  <p>A shift to an open-source model regarding the technology developed for the project could reduce tensions on several of those issues. The application of international law might help in questions of  administration.</p>
  <p>As the project would be underway for a number of years before it involved a permanent human settlement, and a number of years more before there was profit, the scale of cooperation needed to continue working together would only slowly need to grow, and be tested many times before issues of serious consequence needed to be settled.</p>
  <p>For this reason, such an endeavor provides the ideal way to develop the broad international collaboration needed to address long-term peace and prosperity on Earth.</p>

 <article class="column" id="1stPolarTether">
  <h5><a href="machines2.html#TetherTransport">Vertical Skyhook Construction in Polar Orbit</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li><h6>7500 ton Asteroid for the Anchor</h6> is brought into medium polar orbit, 5000 km above the surface. Surveys of Near Earth Asteroids will be much more complete by then, so it is reasonable to expect a carbonaceous asteroid that is suitable will have been found and collected. Its content of carbon and metal would be its most valuable contribution, as water is being mined from the lunar pole at less expense. But its hydrated minerals are still of value.</li>
   <li><h6>Gear Installed and Tested</h6> Zylon cables, construction equipment, solar panels and ion engines, and a nuclear-powered cable car are brought from Earth to the asteroid. Some small scale tests will already have been done in preparation. Now further testing and experimentation is done to ensure a robust design.</li>
   <li><h6>Tether Extended Downwards</h6> from the asteroid towards the surface. The first increment is only a few kilometers, then a hundred kilometers is added, than a thousand. The platform at the foot, the procedure by which the nuclear shuttle meets it and is grappled, oscillation control on the tether, the cable car, and cable car propulsion are all thoroughly tested at these scales and further refined.</li>
   <li><h6>Full Lower Tether</h6>The tether is extended in increments of 1000 km until it reaches an altitude of 20 km above the surface.</li>
   <li><h6>Cable Car Propulsion</h6>The first cable car is nuclear, but it may receive supplemental power beamed from the asteroid in order to increase its capacity. The best method for powering future cars may be beamed power, or nuclear might be the best solution.</li>
   <li><h6>Skyhook's Momentum Saves 4/5th of Delta V</h6> the nuclear shuttle will only need to use 1/5th of the delta V needed to reach and return from lunar orbit to reach the platform of the tether foot and return. It will need that same 1/5th of the normal delta V to go anywhere on the Moon by grappling the platform and hanging off it until it is over its destination, and to return to base the same way. </li>
   <li><h6>Upper Tether</h6> is extended upwards 9500 km, given a cable car designed to ferry ships from the anchor, and a platform at the tip. At the altitude of the tip, release of a vessel gives it enough speed to reach Earth. This construction proceeds much faster as the process is now understood.</li>
   <li><h6>Platform HiPEP Ion Engines</h6> The engines are moved from the asteroid to the tether tip where their force is most effective in maintaining the skyhook's orbit. Short-term, orbital perturbations are compensated for by moving cars that act as counterweights up or down the two tethers. In case of emergency, if somehow the orbital altitude of the structure has lowered and the foot is at risk of crashing into the ground and being dragged across it, a nuclear thermal rocket engine can fire at the tether tip to quickly raise orbit.</li>
   <li><h6>Conversion of the Asteroid to a Space Station</h6> Early steps in that direction are carried out during skyhook construction, replacing payloads of asteroid material with simple vessels and beams made of fused regolith.</li>
   <li><h6>5 km/s Delta V now saved between Moon and Earth</h6>The full skyhook saves about 2 km/s delta V to get something to the Moon from Earth, and 3 km/s to get something back.</li>
   <li><h6>Cheap Moon Fuel</h6>The mining of ice from the poles now is used to fuel the pod ship on the Earth/Moon run, and the nuclear shuttles, completely. Some water is shipped to the space station in LEO so it can be a fuel depot for other ships.</li>
  </ul>
<h5>A Bigger Asteroid Fetcher</h5>
<p>The asteroid retrieval ship remains connected to the anchor asteroid at first, then it is taken apart and upgraded. It gets bigger engines and larger solar panels, its asteroid bagging equipment is improved. While work on the skyhook proceeds, it is sent out again to get a larger asteroid of 25 kilotons.</p>
<p><b>Cargo runs between LEO and the polar skyhook now occur at every opportunity: every 2 weeks, 26 per year.</b></p>
 </article>
 <article class="column" id="InukshukFirstHab">
  <h5><a href="colonies.html#InukshukModels">Completion of First Hab</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li><h6>Fused Regolith Objects</h6>The simple boards, beams, rods and such that the MIP stations can produce are sufficient for the bulk of this hab, without needing cables or fiber reinforcement. They can also be used to produce simple furnishings (tables, shelves, doors, chairs, beds...) and simple implements (jugs, cups, bowls, boxes, shovels, rakes...) </li>
   <li><h6>Imported Objects</h6> - the roof membrane, life support systems, plumbing and wiring, lights, appliances, and more come from Earth and are installed. 3d printers using metal powder have already been successfully used to create certain parts for the robots, and can reduce what must be shipped from Earth a little, but mostly just by reducing the number of replacement parts sent along.  </li>
   <li><h6>Crew of 30 Arrive on 2 Year Mission</h6>Once the hab has been pressurized and all the systems successfully tested, they arrive. At the end of the initial mission they may be rotated out for other people, but the staff remains 30 people. From the outset, this crew is selected based on the psychological philosophy the Residence Program will also follow: they are all couples married at least 10 years, over 40, with no children under 18. As anticipated, most of the original crew chooses to stay on the Moon permanently.</li>
   <li><h6>Development of industrial and farming processes</h6> is their mission. They are able to accomplish a great deal quickly, because operators on Earth continue to  teleoperate the existing equipment. They operate robots remotely from within the hab or a rover with a pressurized cab, or bring things into the hab to work on them. Doing manual labor outside in a spacesuit is avoided because it is clumsy. They are rapidly able to innovate.</li>
   <li>Once they complete the first greenhouse and fill it with healthy plants, greatly increase production of water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, complete the first solar thermal power plant, add a second, much larger hab using an expanded range of local products, and meet a set of test goals demonstrating that it is safe to expand the population, the Residence Program begins</li>
   <li><h6>Inukshuk Base is Declared a Permanent Settlement</h6>Due to the great significance of the first permanent habitat on another celestial body, the first completed hab is simply called First Hab. The second hab becomes known as Long Hab because it is long and narrow.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Sagan Space Station</h5>
  <p><h6>Perfect Place for a Great Telescope</h6> Easy servicing, power and data trasmission provided by existing station infrastructure, mass of the telescope not an issue, aiming and tracking of the scope very easy (though elaborate measures have to be taken to isolate it from vibrations and oscillations due to other activity on the skyhook). The anchor makes an excellent home for a really awesome telescope. For this reason it is named for Carl Sagan, an astronomer who dreamed of space settlement and is a figurehead of the movement. </p>
  <p>Nothing else is planned for this skyhook - activities will occur at Gagarin Station on the equatorial skyhook once it is built. All that needs to happen at Sagan, is that its mass be replaced with bulk regolith and fused regolith structures so its valuable minerals can be extracted at Inukshuk, and it needs to berth the pod ship every two weeks while payload transfers occur, and mechanisms on it need to keep the skyhook's orbit in good shape.</p>
  <p>Once Gagarin is commissioned, the pod ship will berth there instead. Shuttles will continue to use Sagan's skyhook for travel around the Moon, but will no longer send payload up the tether. Instead, they will take payloads to Lalande, and from there they will be sent up Gagarin's skyhook. Once all the useful minerals in Sagan's asteroid are used up, things will be pretty peaceful there. The telescope can be spread out, given multiple mirrors and fancy shades to protect it from heat and radiation. Once it is no longer needed for transport to and from the surface, the telescope's needs dictate development on that skyhook.</p>
 </article>
 <article class="column" id="ResidenceProgramBegins">
  <h5>The Residence Program Begins</h5>
  <p>This is actually the final step of this phase, happening after everything in the other columns is done. However, preparation has been happening for years.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Long Hab houses the first 200 astronauts of the program. Each is a married couple selected by their countries to go to the Moon permanently - to live out the rest of their lives there. For this privilege, these nations pay $150 million per astronaut. All astronauts must meet stiff criteria agreed upon by all the nations:
   <ul>
    <li><h6>Stable Married Couples</h6>They must be a married couple with no children under the age of 18, married at least 10 years, and at least 40 years of age. </li>
    <li><h6>Scientists and Engineers</h6> who can play an active role in studying and developing the Moon. Minimum qualification is both have at least a bachelor's degree in the sciences or engineering, one has a more advanced degree or outstanding professional career in a relevant area.</li>
    <li><h6>Good for Shows</h6>They must participate regularly in programming broadcast back to Earth, both by appearing on camera, and by coming up with content for such programming. There are many options - arts, sports, educational content, conversational content, games. Ability in an art or a sport will be part of the criteria by which they are selected.</li>
    <li><h6>Science and Safety</h6>They must donate their bodies to science upon death.</li>
    <li>As it is so important, might as well just say that they all must have had a vasectomy or a tubal ligation</li>
    <li>They must be in excellent health</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   <li><h6>Broad International Population</h6>Nations may send a number of representatives, but at the same time, there is a deliberate effort to send a group that truly represents all the races, religions, language groups, regions, and ways of life of humanity.</li>
   <li>The crew of First Hab is expanded to 50 when the RP starts. They are the senior staff, who come from the ISA nations. As the Residence Program is the main initial revenue stream, it is made of people from other nations. There is overlap due to, for instance, the many nations of the European Union wishing to have nationals in the settlement, as only a few would have nationals in First Hab. Other space-faring nations may also forego recuperation of their investment in order to have a few more citizens on the Moon. Still, the bulk of the people in RP Round 1 come from places other than the founder nations.</li>
   <li><h6>Affordable Entry</h6>Payment for each spot may be made over 5 years. Today, there are 63 countries in the world with annual national budgets over US$30 billion. Examples of countries at that US$30 billion level include Slovakia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Luxembourg. By the time the program began there would be a number of others.</li>
   <li>Most of the astronauts would probably be in their mid-40s. They would probably be able to actively participate in colony life for at least 30 years. So, those countries in the list in the point above, for 1% of one year's national budget, would get 2 national superstars on the Moon, that can do way more to inspire national pride and collective interest in science and progress than anything they could do at home, for 30 or 40 years.</li>

    <h2>Transport cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Asteroid for Equatorial skyhook arrives in orbit</h5>
    <p>
    This is going to be the real transport hub for the Moon, together with Cernan's Promise and later Lalande City. It develops into a colony in its own right. It is another carbonaceous asteroid, this time massing 25 metric kilotons. It is placed in a circular orbit 5000 km above the surface, so that it has the same orbital period as Sagan Skyhook and they will never be at risk of collision.
    </p>
    <p>
    Upper and lower tethers just like the ones on Sagan are built outwards from the asteroid. These will be reinforced to take bigger payloads over time, and to run multiple payload cars up and down.
    </p>
    <h5>Reusable Rockets</h5>
    <p>The launch rates needed to accomplish the missions after Residence Program Round 2 require one of two things: much higher public enthusiasm for space, or much cheaper launch costs. Rocket stages that are used many times with modest refurbishment in between can reduce launch costs to a fraction of current costs. Roughly, a reusable first stage like SpaceX currently targets, that can be reliably and cheaply reused 20 times, might drop costs to half what they are now. A reusable second stage with the same properties, and mass production rates giving economies of scale, might halve that again.</p>
    <p>There has been enough success to date to clearly indicate someone is going to manage this, be it SpaceX, or Blue Origin, or one of the more established rocket companies. It might take longer than hoped, but it is going to happen.</p>
    <p>The launches needed for Resident Program Rounds 1 and 2 can be done at the best prices currently charged. Plans would not proceed unless Inukshuk Base was producing enough water to provide for all the residents and the needs of the base, and to fuel the shuttle and the pod ship. Thus the tonnage of supplies that would have to be delivered would be manageable. A healthy margin on those astronauts can be had in this architecture, to recoup the costs up to this point. It is important not to proceed unless the robots have preformed up to spec, but once they do, costs are well controlled.</p>
    <p>Rounds 3 and 4 would not yield much margin unless launch costs do drop a lot, or other revenue streams are sufficient. That is the time that depends most on public enthusiasm either justifying the cost or creating the revenue to support it (through broadcasting and such). </p>

    <h2>Colony Dev. cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Expansion of Inukshuk colony</h5>
    <p>
    The First Hab crew and the astronauts of the RP build more infrastructure at Inukshuk. More robotic equipment arrives from Earth to assist, including better 3d printers, reactors for chemical processing, and more advanced robots and rovers. They work through the following list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>Expand ice mining</h6>, separating out a greater range of ice chemicals,  setting up operations in several locations, and raising yield dramatically.</li>
      <li><h6>Quartz production</h6>Develop a good industrial process to produce fused quartz glass, and glass fibers suitable for use as reinforcement in a fused regolith matrix. Once developed, the machinery to do it is built on Earth and shipped up.</li>
      <li><h6>Expand the greenhouses</h6> with the goal of producing most of the residents' food on-site. Improve the range and yield of edible plants grown. Begin raising edible insects as a source of quality protein and fat. Once achieved, about three quarters of calories come from local food, but key things still come from Earth. Oils, grains, and legumes are sent because local production is insufficient, and portions of customary foods are sent because people really miss them - coffee, chocolate, cheese, cured meats, nuts, and some fresh meats and perishables on each run.</li>
      <li><h6>Expand the TESS</h6>The solar thermal plant's capacity is increased to serve all local power needs and provide a source of molten regolith for reactors and construction. A good fraction of this structure is built on-site.</li>
      <li><h6>Build a radio telescope</h6> in a small crater - a fixed one in which the whole crater is simply lined with a mirror, and shaded from Earth to block its radio noise.</li>
      <li><h6>Send the heavy equipment to Lalande</h6>Once the above infrastructure is done, and all the heavy work is done on local buildings, it goes and builds Cernan's Promise.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article class="column" id="RPround1">
    <h2>Socio-Economic Dev. cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Ordinary Life on the Moon</h5>
    <p>The 200 residents from RP round 1 work alongside the First Hab crew to achieve the listed goals. English is the working language. The First Hab crew are the senior staff, and lead RP crews on the various projects. Work largely continues to be done remotely from within the habs at interface stations. </p>
    <p>Each married couple has a small apartment. Kitchens, bathrooms, showers, clothes washers, and everything else that involves plumbing, waste processing, or food is in centralized facilities shared by everyone. The second hab is known as Long Hab, thanks to its long narrow shape. It has a common exercise area, multi-use gathering area, and workshop for the use of residents on their own time. The greenhouses are also set up partially as relaxation and exercise areas. </p>
    <h5>Health Program Developed</h5>
    <p>The First Hab crew stayed healthy before this by an intensive exercise program modeled on that developed for the ISS, but with time better approaches are found.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>Manual centrifuge</h6> this looks sort of like a wide bicycle wheel on its side whose axle is connected to a platform where people spin the wheel using pure muscle power. It takes a while to get going but can then be maintained fairly easily at an RPM that imitates 1 gravity of force for the people on the rim of the wheel. People spend at least an hour on the wheel at a time, at least several times a week, so their circulatory system can redistribute fluids and to relieve other subtle issues with long term low gravity living. Exercise needs to be done while under the full gravity. The exercise of pushing the wheel is also beneficial. Motors are also added so there is no need to push, but usually they aren't used. </li>
      <li><h6>Swimming pool</h6> The water gotten from the ice mining makes this rather easy to do. At first it is a couple of shallow swimming lanes, then a deep end is added, then a diving tank, and the whole thing is made deeper to take full advantage of the kind of swimming lunar gravity makes possible. The benefit of swimming in low gravity is that the water has the same inertia as it has on Earth, so the force needed to push it aside is almost the same. Swimming is the same kind of workout on the Moon as it is here. </li>
      <li><h6>Lunar parkour</h6> The kind of constant downward pull we feel on Earth can be acquired briefly on the Moon by jumping over a high enough distance, or climbing upwards fast enough. Instead of stairs, tubes are used to move between floors, where you grab the sides and haul yourself up. With practise, residents learn to do this so fast it is a sort of vertical running. People often jump between floors as well. It becomes a passtime to find new and exciting ways to move around the habs by bouncing off walls, swinging from things, and jumping great distances. </li>
      <li><h6>Lunar gym</h6> In order to get the same kind of acceleration-oriented exercise, the gym area is the full height of Long Hab, and its floor is so heavily padded that even if someone jumps from the very top if it, they will land unharmed. The foam used is stiff enough that in the low gravity it can be walked over fairly normally, but yeilds sufficiently to absorb the energy of a jump from a great height. The padded walls are covered with small ledges and recesses for hand and foot holds, there are a bunch of ropes and nets hanging from ceiling to floor. The residents quickly start inventing vertically oriented sports and games. </li>
    </ul>

  <article class="column" id="GagarinStation">
    <h5>The Equatorial Skyhook becomes Gagarin Station</h5>
    <p>
    The asteroid is mined, and as material from it is sent down to Cernan's Promise, components for a space station are sent back up, plus gravel and rocks to maintain or increase its mass. This space station will expand over time to fill certain economic niches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>Microgravity Manufacturing</h6> with the Moon colonies there to send up raw materials and manufactured items, the asteroid is a good place for this. Perhaps if lunar material can be used to produce cheap enough heat shields, it would even be possible to send certain goods to Earth's surface within a budget that made sense, by releasing them from the upper tether on a trajectory that skims Earth's atmosphere. </li>
      <li><h6>Staging area for deep-space missions</h6> As the manufacturing of space infrastructure grows as an industry at Cernan's Promise, it becomes valuable to assemble the final ship and payload for many deep-space missions at Gagarin. Only the things that can't be produced on the Moon need to come from Earth. Once ready, the ships are given a significant speed boost by the launch from the upper tether, allowing them to get quickly on their way.</li>
      <li><h6>Shipyard</h6> Extending the previous idea, final assembly and outfitting of components from Cernan's Promise to produce whole spaceships is done at the asteroid. Some parts need to come from Earth, but not a lot. Nuclear thermal and nuclear electric ships are built. Also solar sail ships. These kinds of ships would gain even more advantage than other designs through launch-release from the upper tether. Nuclear thermal ships can avoid firing engines where the radiation spray could damage installations on the asteroid surface, low-thrust solar sail and nuclear electric ships save a ton of time by avoiding the need to break orbit themselves. </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Expansion of the Lunar Fleet</h5>
    <p><h6>3 More Nuclear Shuttles and 3 More Pod Ships</h6> Let us estimate that many are needed for an agile fleet by the end of this period. They may need to be larger than the first ones. These are simply to support Gagarin, the shipyard, and the Residence Program. They also transport some official visitors and a modest number of tourists.</p>
    <p><h6>Asteroid Fetch Ships</h6> Several are launched by private companies. The Moon Agency enforces regulations on these activities and has jurisdiction to seize the ships if necessary, or may take a range of lesser actions.</p>
    <p><h6>Space Tugs</h6> Several also start to operate out of Gagarin Station under private operation. They service satellites or salvage dead ones, and deliver ones made at Cernan's Promise to their orbits. The MA regulates these too.</p>
    <p><h6>Agency Ships</h6>Two small, powerful nuclear ships are built, which stay docked at Gagarin, there if needed. They are mostly for the purpose of rescue operations, but also send the message that if the MA decides to seize your ship, it can. Like everything else, they can pilot themselves, but they have pressurized cabins sufficient for a small crew.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="column" id="ConstructCP">
    <h5>Construction of Cernan's Promise</h5>
    <p>It goes on the East rim of Lalande Crater, and uses Lalande's mineral wealth to create an extensive construction industry. It is named Cernan's Promise in rememberance of the last words spoken on the Moon, by Gene Cernan: 'We leave as we came and God willing as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind'.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>First Hab and Other Prep</h6>The initial hab is built, for the construction crew who then become the senior staff. So it is also called First Hab. The surrounding area is paved. A nuclear generator is set up in a small crater near the site. A set of MIP stations, and an initial basalt fiber production facility specializing in cable are made and used in the First Hab construction. It is designed for a staff of 40 people. Once completed, that staff takes up residence and oversees further construction.</li>
      <li><h6>Construction Stages</h6>These are the buildings and infrastructure portrayed in <a href="colonies.html#Phase1_Overview">this 3d model</a>. Cernan's Promise is by far the most developed virtual colony right now. Most of the items in the list are labelled there with the names referred to here. This is roughly the stages in which they are built:
      <ol>
        <li>Solar thermal power plant (TESS phase 1), full-scale basalt fiber production unit, initial industrial hangar with first dust-roasters, vacuum deposition furnace, 3d printers, and cryogenic storage area </li>
        <li>Big atrium, gallery (phase 1), beginning of glass production, first fluidized bed reactors</li>
        <li>Large hangar with minimal atmosphere, 2nd standard hangar, TESS phase 2, first sports hab, extend upper gallery, south long atrium, proper spaceport</li>
        <li>Complete upper gallery, 2nd TESS on hilltop, south hangar cluster, north long atrium </li>
        <li>Teacup crater, lower gallery with sports habs and bottom dome</li>
        <li>Mega-atrium</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is achieved quickly because the robots are continually upgraded, more are shipped in or built, and they become able to do more and more without supervision. One of the fabrication lines built in the hangars of stage 3 manufactures robots that are added to the workforce, as well as some being sent to Gagarin. They need only a few circuit boards, sensors, motors, and actuators from Earth to go to work. The construction of all these things only takes 7 years, even as the factories of CP also send structures and equipment to other expanding settlements.</p>
    <h5>Commerce and Industry at Cernan's Promise</h5>
    <p>In the hangars around CP, many things are built - parts for satellites, space ships, space stations, skyhook components, and robotic machinery for space and for the Moon. At first the revenue from this is small, as the production mostly goes to projects of the ISA and the Moon Agency, but it grows quickly. The structures built in stages 5 and 6 are used to host myriad events that boost broadcasting revenue, which is an important income, and for tourism, which is a minor revenue stream but important for more general social reasons. These structures are the outstanding features making people flock to move to the Moon after the end of the RP. </p>
    <h5>Gagarin Station</h5>
    <p>Even as all the above is happening, components for Gagarin Station are are also made and shipped out - tanks, trusses, frames, hulls, windows, arms, rails. Similar components are made and sent to expand the ISS, plus bulk regolith shielding, and a large tank of water. A few satellites are made and placed in orbit.</p>
    <h5>Expansion of Inukshuk Colony</h5>
    <p>As the population grows, more greenhouses are needed. Ice mining also expands, now being done in a whole set of craters. The ice mining is now almost completely automated. The population at Inukshuk levels off at 1000 people, and everyone else goes to Lalande. </p>
  </article>
  <article class="column" id="RPround2-5">
    <h5>Residence Program rounds 2 through 4</h5>
    <p>Total population at the completion of these events is 3200 people - 3000 from the RP, and 200 from the ISA nations who continue to administer the colonies. </p>
    <p><h6>The Moon Agency</h6> is created at this point, and staff is extended beyond the existing management staff to include some of the residents. The MA oversees colony activity beyond this point, following the dictates of a treaty created to establish its policies.</p>
    <p><h6>Cultural Impact Back Home</h6>Some programming broadcast from the colonies becomes quite popular on Earth. Certain sports have evolved into something unique and entertaining, and there are now leagues of small competing teams, and scheduled matches for several sports that include annual championships. A sort of variety talk show has also become very popular. An annual arts event gets considerable attention and includes virtual participation by people on Earth. Many of the video blogs of different resident groups have large loyal followings. The lunar population includes a number of people who have become international celebrities, and even more who are major celebrities in their home countries.</p>
    <h5>The Moon Fund and Opening of the Economy</h5>
    <p>The lunar economy nears break even during these events, which triggers a set of pre-agreed actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Moon Fund is created and all lunar finances from existing industry then go through it. How profits from that are distributed, once they exist, becomes a very delicate matter. The situation was forseen, but the particulars couldn't be predicted, so there is a lot of haggling about the details.</li>
      <li>At the end of Round 4, the most robust industries are privatized. Others will be privatized as they reach certain milestones. Transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and all other infrastructure judged vital to the health and safety of the residents, continues to be held in common and governed by the Moon Agency.</li>
      <li>Privatizations follow a standard procedure. Each privatized installation becomes a publicly traded corporation with a set of bylaws which may be expanded, but may not be changed or removed, and which are binding.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h6>Cooperative Dynamics</h6>Privatization does not change the contract made with the RP astronauts that their needs are covered for life, nor would it make sense to change that arrangement. They still raise the crops, do the maintenance and repairs - they do everything that keeps the colonies functioning, including looking after transport, power, and telecoms infrastructure that, starting at the end of Round 4, now goes partly to provide services to private companies. All colony resources are essentially held in common, as far as providing for the people there goes.</p>
    <p><h6>Informal Economy</h6>As time goes on, there are increasing numbers of deals between residents for goods and services that are extras. There is barter, and sometimes exchanges of funds between Earth-side accounts, which are then used to have extra luxury items delivered. It is usually used for favorite foods, extra clothing, and small furnishings. Towards the end of this period, the freedom of residents to have contracts with entities on Earth and be paid increases, and the wealth of some residents suddenly increases as a result.</p>

</div>
<div class="columnSet">
  <article class="column" id="MoreTethers">
    <h5>Addition of 3 More Polar Skyhooks</h5>
    <p>The original asteroid retrieval ship, now heavily upgraded, delivers asteroids for the remaining skyhooks for the Moon. They are placed in staggered polar orbits, one every 90&deg;, and all the skyhooks have the same orbital period so they will never interfere with each other. All three mass 25 kilotons, like the Gagarin asteroid. One is again carbonaceous, the other two are mostly metal. They are developed into skyhooks like Sagan, minus the telescope and with less living volume. Mining equipment goes to all three, but there is little call for human habitation on them and they have only basic facilities for a small, occasional crew. The mining and transport work is overseen remotely and is largely automatic. </p>
    <p><h6>Lunar Transport Network Spreads Development</h6>With this system complete, the maximum wait between convenient trajectories to or from a skyhook is 3.5 days anywhere on the Moon. With a reasonable fuel penalty, most places are accessible much more regularly. In a pinch a rescue crew can get anywhere in a few hours using the shuttles alone. So, now ice mining starts at the south pole as well, and many other places on the Moon are explored more extensively. In a few places, valuable ores, or very large lava tubes, or some especially exciting discovery is found, and expeditions begin development or exploration there.</p>
    <h5>Coil Gun Use Begins</h5>
    <p>Cernan's Promise starts using coil guns to launch cargo to the foot of Gagarin, or straight into orbit or on a trajectory for LEO. These launches are in capsules that have thrusters sufficient for course corrections or orbital maneuvers, and most are reusable. Some can also be decelerated by a catcher with a similar structure on return, that system is made after the initial coil gun.</p>
    <p><h6>Lalande B</h6>, at 8 km across and about 30 km north of Lalande, is used for this purpose. All spaceport activity is transferred there over time to provide a buffer zone between it and Lalande City. It also has  an even shape and smooth walls so the coil guns over time can be made longer, and to swivel on a track around the crater rim in order to launch or catch in any direction.</p>
    <h5><a href="machines2.html#EarthTether">Earth Orbital Skyhook Work Begins</a></h5>
    <p>Another jump up in mass moved, the asteroid delivered to be the anchor mass is 200 kilotons of material, largely metallic. Its orbit is circularized at 10,000 km altitude, and a tether is built earthwards to an altitude of 250 km. At first the tether is only sufficient for berthing of a small ship at the foot platform, of 10 tons. </p>
    <p>This is sufficient for transport of the Round 5 astronauts. Reusable rockets optimized for the delta V needed to reach the foot platform are used to get them there. With these rockets, launch costs do indeed drop to a tiny fraction of what they were before.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="column" id="FillIn">
    <h5>Structures Filled In and Capacity Increased</h5>
    <p><h6>Creating a Homey Feel</h6>While all the structures of Cernan's Promise and Inukshuk now exist, they are only slowly filling up. They were designed to be blank canvasses that fill in organically over time. As the population expands, they build their homes within these spaces. Each arriving group is given temporary lodging, and asked to split themselves into groups of 30 people. Each group is given an area surrounding a basic set of facilites - a cold pantry, a set of sinks, appliances, and showers, gear for a good number of distributed electrical outlets, charging stations, lights, taps, and drains. They are given guidelines on floorspace allotment, but are permitted to combine or trade space within some limits. They are able to use the MIP stations, 3d printers, and other gear to have custom houses made and assembled. As there is no need to install plumbing or any weather protection in their homes, the gravity is so low, and prefab electrical stuff can be easily clipped onto things, the design options for the homes are wide open.</p>
    <p><h6>Organization Around Shared Kitchen and Bath</h6> The kitchens, baths, and washing areas each group sets up for their homes are very personalized and identified with each group. (Toilets are the only such amenity not shared - Each apartment gets a waterless composting toilet and a small sink that runs from a water tank. The toilets don't smell and their products are needed in the gardens.) In this process each group forges a group identity and come to feel they are at home. Their creations feel like mini-spas and picnic spots. Some people choose to pool the floorspaces assigned to them to build more elaborate, larger shared houses. Groups can take in more members if they wish, but the practical limit on the number of people who can comfortably share the resources they are given is about 50. Where personalities don't mesh, spaces are exchanged and people join a different group, sometimes then deciding to alter their houses. The cost of this is minimal as the equipment is there and not fully occupied, and the structures are easily altered.</p>
    <p><h6>Local Ecosystem</h6>The atriums, Teacup, and the polar greenhouses are filled with plants. The crops yielded incease in quality, quantity, and variety as knowledge is gained and resources increase. The colonies near food independence. Some animals now range free in small numbers within garden areas, including select flying insects, small lizards, and birds. </p>
    <p>The colonists decide upon and build all the shared facilities they need or enjoy. Office space, workshops, gardens, forums, sports arenas, gathering spots, exercise facilities, event areas, chapels and churches, display areas, meeting rooms, and anything else that isn't included in official construction. There are general guidelines for the things the colonists build but they have a lot of leeway. The official things include medical facilities, storage areas for food and all sorts of supplies, administrative offices, and everything to do with transport or industry. These things are built according to official plans and standards.</p>
    <p>The hangars are filled in with machinery and a variety of products are developed. A wider variety of components are produced for shipment into space. A larger proportion of the robots and machines that do this are produced on site. Quartz glass, basalt composites, mirrors, basalt cloth and cable, and fiberoptics are produced in bulk. Metal objects of iron, magnesium, nickel, and cobalt are stamped, extruded, or made in molds in significant quantities. Specialized items in a variety of metals are 3d printed. </p>
    <p>The spaceport is moved mostly to Lalande B and its capacity is ramped up as fast as possible. </p>
  </article>
  <article class="column">
    <h5>With Greater Resident Freedom, A Unique Culture Begins to Form</h5>
    <p><h6>Economic Approaches</h6>For the first time, more than half of colonists' work time is not devoted to duties assigned by the Moon Agency. Some duties that were previously under its auspices are now done by private businesses. Colonists who performed those duties can now choose whether they want to continue them in exchange for pay or a share of profits with the companies now in charge, set up their own businesses in these areas, or branch out into something else. Because the needs of life will always be free, of the colonists who don't sign up with the companies created by privatization, there is a fairly even split between those who choose a non-commercial approach in the work they come up with, and those who start commercial businesses in new areas or in competition with the privitization companies. </p>
    <p><h6>Living in the Commons</h6>A sizable fraction spend their free time on activities with no clear goal. Their sense of security is very high. Food, shelter, medical care, transport, utilities, basics for clothing, furnishings, and household goods, communication and internet access - all of these things are free. The food even includes a modicum of the extras from Earth that have become part of standard shipments - coffee, cheese, preserved meats and seafood, sweets, sauces. They each get a new mobile computer every time the MA upgrades, for the purpose of doing MA work. They get annual care packages of favored clothing and personal items. They are set for life - that was the deal.</p>
    <p>Because the community remains small and close-knit, and is composed of very successful people specifically chosen for their stability, adaptability, and keen minds, the dichotomy of commercial and non-commercial approaches coexists without significant issues arising. A social order takes hold that is centered on the group of people with whom a colonist shares kitchen and bath. Most administration is done via these groups.</p>
    <h5>Residence Program Round 5</h5>
    <p>Once the lower tether of the Earth skyhook is in place, it is used to transport most of the round 5 astronauts to the Moon. </p>
  </article>
</div>
<div class="columnSet">
  <article class="column" id="EarthTetherComplete">
    <h5>Earth Orbital skyhook Completed</h5>
    <p>The lower tether is built up into a set of ribbons able to accomodate several cars travelling up and down. Cars are able to take payloads of up to 50 metric tons, the foot can berth a ship of up to 200 tons. The upper tether is designed to ferry ships docked at the anchor station up the tether until they are released at the right altitude for their destination. This can only be done one at a time, but ships can still be launched that way up to once a day.</p>
    <p>The anchor station becomes a hub of space activity and starts to grow into a community. It is named Anshar Station after the Sumerian god of the heavens.</p>
    <p>Because the velocity needed to reach the skyhook foot is so much lower, rockets that are fully reusable hundreds of times with minimal repair and maintenance become common, and are able to deliver about 4 times as much payload for each ton of fuel as rockets today.</p>
    <p>The precious metals in the anchor asteroid are alone enough to pay for the cost of building this skyhook complex - especially platinum, palladium, and gold.</p>
    <h5>The Moon Hosts a Fleet</h5>
    <p>Between Anshar lowering the cost to the Moon much further, and a highly automated construction industry on the Moon now able to build almost complete ships of several kinds all on its own, soon there is actually a fleet in space. The Moon Agency supervises and regulates this fleet. </p>
    <h5>Retrieval of Asteroids</h5>
    <p>These conditions make asteroid retrieval clearly profitable. They can be brought in for extraction of their rare platinum-group metals, or so the iron and nickel in them can be used as construction materials in space, or to form the bulk of a space station, or so the water and carbon in them can be used as radiation shielding and life support for space stations or the lunar colonies.</p>
    <p>Most of the initial fleet ships are in the asteroid retrieval business.</p>
  </article>
  <article class="column" id="LalandeDome">
    <h5>Lalande City Begun</h5>
    <p>A factory that is almost completely automated, using not fixed machinery but robots and rovers able to move anywhere and do everything from prospecting new ore sites to doing quality control on final products, might as well be set the task of doing something that was previously impossible.</p>
    <p>So, the first such end-to-end factory to do it all is set to building Lalande City. It starts with the quartz dome over everything, including the towers from floor to dome spaced throughout it, and the the rim structures that connect the dome to the ground and house all sorts of living space and infrastructure. The mines sunk into the central mountains and the lower crater walls, now extensive, are incorporated into the city. For the most part, they are now abandoned, or active mining is so far from the actual crater that it can be isolated from the city and connected to the surrounding factories by other routes. </p>
    <p>Robots and automation have become so able that the robotic portion of construction takes only a decade. The robots build the power plants and factories needed to build all the other robots needed to build the factories needed to fabricate all the fused quartz dome sections, all the composite basalt beams and fittings, the basalt cable, and all the myriad other things. They build the robots that assemble the dome support structures and raise the towers, starting from the center mountains and moving outwards, until the towers are complete and a latticework of beams and cables runs between them and down their cores. They make the rim structures the dome edges sit on, and the anchors for the dome cables around the rim and under each tower. They place the quartz segments, seal the joints, and fuse the crater floor into solid stone. They put in endless plumbing, wiring, lighting, heat pumps, fiberoptics, comms systems, sensors, airlocks, recycling systems.</p>
    <p>They lay down regolith enriched into fertile soil over almost the entire crater interior, creating terraces and stabilized slopes. They fill the dome with air, fill ponds and artificial creeks with water, moisten the soil, and plant an initial crop of grasses everywhere. They test everything carefully. Then the doors are opened, and the robots have to go find something else to do. The factories they made to do this become part of the construction industry surrounding the crater, the power plants provide the initial power for the city and expanded industry.</p>
    <p>The city isn't finished until the end of Round 7. When it is opened, many of the RP residents move out into it, and when private citizen residents begin to arrive, many settle there.</p>
    <h5>Anshar Station</h5>
    <p>Microgravity and vacuum manufacturing takes off. Delivery of the output to Earth is cheap enough using the skyhook and automated reentry vehicles for greatly expanded development of the method. Anshar fills with research labs and small specialized factories. The satellite launch and servicing industry is also centered there. Large hotels and recreational facilities spring up. </p>
    <p>The asteroid that forms the anchor mass of Anshar is mined for a long time, and its mass replaced as it is taken away to Earth or the Moon mostly with lunar rocks. However there is a market for other kinds of asteroids at Anshar. Several with lots of ice and carbon are sold there, and a few stony ones with a different mix of minerals. </p>
    <h5>Gagarin Station</h5>
    <p>The shipyard grows much larger, and some stuff previously done on the surface is now done at the station, using material from asteroids delivered by mining companies as raw materials.</p>
    <p>An O'Neill cylinder begins to be extended from either side of the top of the station, oriented north-south. This space is designed to be expanded outwards over time. It too is mostly made with material from arriving asteroids.</p>

    <h5>Residence Program Rounds 6 and 7</h5>
    <p>In anticipation of the day when the public can buy residence in Cernan's Promise, clusters of homes and related facilities are scattered through the full volume of the existing buildings, so that the RP residents aren't isolated from future residents. The 19,200 people in the final RP rounds fill in the lower reaches of the upper gallery, all the lower gallery, and the mega-atrium with clumps of homes. It is still more efficient for groups of people to share facilities with plumbing, meaning kitchens, baths, and washing areas. Groups of 30 to 40 people share each such area, and this has already become a cultural preference. Such groups become identified as micro-communities and work almost like tribes. They are referred to as cells, cliques, or bands.</p>
    <p>Arriving residents continue to be officially employed by the Moon Agency, but only part time in most cases, usually one or two days a week on average. MA duties for residents narrow to community oriented tasks - developing and raising crops, expanding the set of organisms in the local ecosystem, maintenance and repairs, waste processing, construction of shared facilities for the general population, planning and administration, medical services, monitoring of safety procedures and standards compliance, ongoing research such as medical testing, and everything to do with transport and telecommunications.</p>
    <p>Many incoming residents now have arrangements with one of the private companies that have taken over mining, manufacturing, and commercial research, or with the foundations created to administer pure science research facilities such as the telescopes. (Those foundations are in turn administered by the MA, but are mostly independent.) Many others come with their own plans. A large proportion of new residents are now not sponsored by countries, but by universities, foundations, religious institutions, or professional associations. Some of the foundations were specifically created for the purpose of sponsoring RP astronauts, and send them to fulfill a specific agenda.</p>
    <p>For instance, some of them acquire permission to erect their own transmitters and become private broadcasters. Some come to play the new sports that have become so popular, turning them semi-pro. Some come to start a new company or to conduct private research. Some are artists or thinkers who use the Moon as a platform to create works of art or spread a message. </p>
    <p>A local virtual currency is created. People have accounts that are files containing records of transactions and a tally of credits, in a distributed system that uses the majority of the computers on the colony to maintain so many encrypted copies of the accounts that it is impossible to falsify transactions (similar to Bitcoin). Sometimes the system is used for creation and witnessing of contracts, from simple bets and barter exchanges to swapping homes. Nothing under the auspices of the MA uses this system, however. As always, the needs of life are free. </p>
    <p>There is enough need for conflict resolution that there are a small number of people who are sort of police, and something that is sort of like a court. The court handles contract disputes involving the private companies, and increasingly also the contracts created between residents. Occasionally it also handles disturbances such as physical fights, harassment cases, property damage, or theft. </p>
    <p> Contract cases are a simple matter of interpreting the contract, and if it was not clear, the matter goes to mediation, and if that does not work, the contract is cancelled and the court rules on any distribution or exchange of property or funds involved. The court doesn't rule on how things are intrepreted, only on whether something is or isn't clear and thus must go to mediation.</p>
    <p>Disturbances are always handled by mediation. The involvement of people close to the those involved in the disturbance is heavy. The court provides mediation but the responsibility for resolving problems is placed on the cells of people that share kitchen and bath, or who do a shared activity such as coilgun operation or ecosystem development. In the very rare case of a truly violent act, the resident is expelled from the colony and returns to Earth. This happens only maybe once or twice during the entire Resident Program.</p>
    <p>All the residents are highly conditioned to a system where you labor for the common good, and receive the needs of life for free. They have lived that way for at least a couple of decades before the Residence Program ends. In anticipation of the arrival of residents after that point who go through a much more basic selection process, and in response to dynamics created by the growth of private enterprise, the residents of Cernan's Promise create a constitution. It is not recognized by Earth governments, but all the residents swear to uphold it, and the MA takes it very seriously. </p>
    <p>That constitution states that all the things they have become accustomed to having for free shall always be free for Moon residents - food, shelter, medical services, electricity, telecommunications, public transport, basic clothing and furnishings. That each micro-community (referred to as a cell, or sometimes a clique) of those who share kitchen and bath shall be responsible for seeing that all their members receive these things in a way sufficient for health, and each such cell shall perform its share of duties for common good that make it possible for these things to be free. That if there is a disagreement about this, mediation may be sought, but members may not be expelled from a cell. Members may only switch cells by mutual agreement. That the contract system that has grown out of the virtual currency shall be the authority for the creation and monitoring of interpersonal commitments that merit a contract - including such things as marriage. That the virtual currency shall be the Moon's only currency, and that it may not be used to charge interest. </p>
    <p>The first pregnancies occur. After a lot of careful assessment and monitoring, the precautions needed become clear. There is no danger to the embryo for the first 8 weeks or so as long as the mother isn't outside in the radiation of the surface much. The embryo is small enough that gravity plays little role. As the fetus becomes larger there is a greater need for exposure to something close to a full Earth gravity. Pregnancies are completed on Earth or in a few cases on Anshar or Gagarin in areas with simulated gravity of a full 1 g. </p>
    <p>The real issue is how children grow. Minor irregularities are detected rather quickly when infants spend more than a day or two in lower gravity, and so they are taken to Earth to grow up.</p>

    <h1>The Space Boom</h1>
    <p> If not already obvious from some of the grand plans in the previous section, this is the beginning of the Space Boom. Many missions that were previously highly impractical or impossible are now pursued. The possibilities beyond this point are so varied and vast it is hard to make any predictions, other than that everything will change. The scope that Moonwards can cover right now is too small to consider the many projects that would be started at this point. What is here can be considered as a sampling.</p>
    <p>An example for Earth orbit: it makes complete sense that a number of additional skyhook complexes in LEO would shortly be erected, of even greater capacity. Satellite orbits and space debris are now controlled such that there is little collision concern. Several skyhook complexes are placed in polar orbits, allowing almost the entirety of common satellite work to be done on the skyhook stations instead - communications, data transmission, broadcasting, earth observation, mapping services. So, the tether feet are lowered almost to the Karman line, 100 km above the Earth's surface. </p>
    <p>An example for deep space: automated ships start to fly out to Saturn's rings, where they capture chunks of ice from the rings in giant bags. The water ice is delivered to the Moon and the space stations, where it is mostly used to create permanent infrastructure: artificial lakes and rivers, transparent shielding over large areas. These ships can bring back 50 to 100 kilotons of pure water ice on a single run, and a fleet of them simply shuttle back and forth continuously</p>
    <p>An example for cis-lunar space: an O'Neill cylinder is now practical, an asteroid of appropriate size and composition is brought to L5 and work begins.</p>
    <p>Cloud cities above Venus? Colonies on Mars and its moons? Colonies on the terminator of Mercury? On Ceres? On Callisto? Sure! Not all at once, it depends what interests people most, but any of these plans is now feasible. </p>

    <h2>Colony Dev cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Lalande City Complete</h5>
    <p> The city is opened for habitation just before the Residence Program is over. When people start to move in, there are some ground rules.</p>
    <p>The floor of the crater is for orchards and parkland exclusively, except for a few large structures for gatherings - one giant stadium, several smaller arenas, several open-air theaters also usable as forums, and a smattering of plazas. It takes a few years before all that area is planted, but nobody is permitted to build there. Camping is permitted. </p>
    <p>The towers, the rim structures, and all the large voids created by mining are used for living, leisure, and work space. The largest beams between towers also have multi-level bridges hanging under them wide enough that they are lined with buildings. People also work in the factories (not as laborers, but as engineers, technicians and administrators) and research facilities surrounding the crater. The tallest towers are 5 km high and house 40,000 people each once fully developed. It takes about 20 years for the city to fill up with people, and when the population reaches its designated limit, the city is home to 1.5 million people. After that property may change hands but no new homes are allowed. Population growth is directed to newer cities.</p>
    <p> The orchards and other crops provide the majority of the citizens' food. In the ideal, pest-free growing environment, trees bear fruit three times a year. Thanks to breeding and genetic manipulation, the trees grow to gigantic heights. Each harvest is a tremendous amount of food. Only trees, bushes, and vines that produce food crops are grown on the ground (and assorted light undergrowth). Slowly rotating hanging gardens far above produce vegetables. As the sun during the day is so strong, these gardens are necessary to weaken the light hitting the ground by creating a partly cloudy feeling, while making best use of that energy to produce food. At night the hanging gardens are kept healthy with artificial light. The woody plants on the ground also receive a bit of supplemental light, but they have been bred to handle the long nights. They go into hibernation at these times and are not affected much. Specialized greenhouses near the crater produce grains and legumes at high density using mechanized rotating trays and light distributed through fiberoptic cables. Carbon dioxide levels are maintained at about 2000 parts per million in the city, 5 times current levels on Earth, to aid plant growth. </p>
    <p>Animal husbandry is also practised. Bees produce honey, chickens produce eggs, a number of edible insects and larvae are farmed, as are a few kinds of fish. The chickens wander free in the orchards, and have tiny trackers that make locating their nests quite easy. A number of insects have been introduced as pollinators, and also some hummingbirds and bats. There are a variety of reptiles and birds. There were some problems with population explosions, and so cats are introduced. Dogs, however, have no role in the ecosystem. Some are brought as pets but they are not permitted to reproduce. Other animals that have been sterilized are permitted for study or as pets. New species are only introduced after much study. The addition of many things, such as small fast-breeding mammals or large animals, is considered unwise. Extensive tracking is done on animal populations and anything large and long-lived enough to have a pinhead-sized tracker, has one. </p>
    <p>The crater has several tiny lakes and a few artificial creeks. There is a sort of suspended sprinkler system that is a bit like rain that falls in small patches. Very large lightweight reflectors are used to increase sunlight levels near dawn and dusk, and reduce them at noon. Temperature regulation is done mostly by pumping heat into the ground and some use of radiators. Power continues to be mostly TESS plants, with some nuclear generators mixed in, and perhaps some solar power beamed from the skyhooks.</p>

  <article class="column" id="TrueSociety">
    <h2>Socio-Economic Dev cont'd</h2>
    <h5>A Truly Unique Society</h5>
    <p>When residence is opened to any applicant, there is a flood of interest. The MA, and the Moon's general population, are leery of how this will affect their cozy, cerebral society. The MA decides to continue to impose some conditions on who qualifies, and creates an application structure that inherently favors certain qualities. Principally, they make it so long and involved that it requires considerable patience, concentration, and persistence to complete it. The MA also decides to accept only 15,000 applicants a year for the first 5 years, and then raise the number to 50,000 for 5 years, and then to 100,000 or 10% of the Moon's total population, whichever is more. There continue to be many more applicants than spaces for decades. Some applicants pay the fee by making agreements to do work for some entity when they arrive. </p>
    <p>A few spots are handed out by lottery, after which a winner need only comply with the basic qualifications of a clean criminal record and good physical health. They must also pay the fee.</p>
    <h5>Children on the Moon</h5>
    <p>It starts being possible to raise children in Lalande City from a younger and younger age, if a program of exercise is followed and some highly targeted hormonal drugs are used at certain ages. Once a child is able to be physically active in an independent way, they can live on the Moon - usually starting around age 3. Then they are able to do the important exercises needed to maintain health. Exercise programs are designed for children that are more enjoyable for them and tailored to their needs, and there are many places in the colony where they can do them together, in classes with teachers. They need more time in higher simulated gravity, and very spacious centrifuges are created for them. It isn't easy or pleasant to move around a lot in these centrifuges. You can stand and move around, helped by the slanted floors and plenty of railings, but you are always being pulled in two directions - 1 g outwards and 1/6th g downwards. Children are given quiet things to do when they are there, or nap, or sometimes sleep overnight there.</p>
    <p>For a long time children continue to be uncommon enough that they are really very pampered and are cared for in a highly communal way. When couples return to their lunar homes with their toddlers, their cliques become an enthusiastic band of uncles, aunts, and grandparents. The average age on the Moon at the end of the RP is mid-50s. The absence of children is widely seen by colonists as the city's greatest flaw. Even a decade after settlement is opened up, many bands don't even have one child in their midst. Children can wander around freely because everyone looks out for them. The MA begins favoring settlers with plans to have children.</p>
    <p>The lunar population would like families to be able to stay, through pregnancy and their children's infancy, without the huge interruption to community life caused by leaving for Earth until their child is 3. They would like more children around, and want to make that as easy as possible for people. So an installation is created on Gagarin Station for couples who are pregnant or have infants. Gagarin already has hotels and installations on spinning levels that simulate Earth gravity, but a new one is made that caters purely to these families and is specialized for their needs. It is large enough to accomodate hundreds of young families, and can be extended. It is basically an O'Niell cylinder built onto the top of Gagarin (in two balanced halves so it doesn't create torque on the station). </p>
    <p> By combining staying on this station with use of the centrifuges when they visit Lalande, couple are able to maintain ties and continue working with much less interruption. Many couple adopt this approach, some couples prefer to go to Earth through this period.  </p>
    <p>Because the populations remains highly selected for qualities valued by the astronauts of the RP, its strong inclination towards a communal approach to life becomes ever more ingrained. The environment is almost completely controlled, there has always been plenty of money flowing to keep the vested interests back on Earth happy, the population is universal in its interest in science, and there are absolutely no economic pressures on anyone - their needs are all looked after. All this, and the approach to currency, contracts, and disputes, and the cellular structure of the society, has prevented authority from becoming concentrated. People identify very strongly with their cliques, and the cliques protect their members energetically, so there never appears any unprotected underclass, or any privileged overclass. The population doesn't think much about self-determination, because there is no conflict with Earth. Earth governments are fine with them administering their own affairs, as there is plenty of room for companies to spring up and grow, most research and technical innovation is shared thanks to long-standing open-source policies, and the MA has done a good job making sure all business operations have access to the power, telecoms, transport, and other infrastructure they need. </p>
    <p>Of course, something has to disturb this Shangri-La. Perhaps it should be the creation of another city, built by a private real-estate enterprise. The MA has been allowed to control Lalande City, Inukshuk, and the space stations because they are part of the original international deal that got the Moon settled. But now nations and groups want to strike out on their own and create something different. One of the first such enterprises builds a Las Vegas in space that violates most of Lalande City's ideals. </p>
