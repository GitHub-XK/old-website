title: Timeline for Lunar Colonization
description: Events leading to colonization of the Moon, steps taken for profitable lunar industry, and the foundation of a lunar society.
headline: The Path to a Lunar Society
intro: What matters is understanding what <i>needs</i> to happen, and what <i>can</i> happen. The dates aren't important. Nothing determines the dates more than the priority the people of the space-faring nations place on this goal. This page explains the best conceivable path if the will is there and the politics of conflict is set aside. If we were really aware of what amazing things we could achieve if only we worked together, perhaps we would find the will to do so. Take what follows as an illustration of what that could be.

  <h1>Transport Systems</h1>
  <details>
  <summary>The key to success</summary>
   <p>
    Europeans colonized the world thanks to their great sailing ships. Railroads were vital to expansion across the North American continent. Almost any level of investment is justfied if it secures you access long-term to a large enough place. When that new place is the rest of the solar system? Bet the bank on it.
    The difference between reliance on chemical rockets and reliance on the system below is like the difference between wagon trains and steam locomotives. Railroads completely changed what was possible, this is the same thing.
   </p>
   <p>The cost of transport is currently a high percentage of the total cost of space missions. Total loss of missions due to launch failure, engine failure in space, or landing failure is frequent. Long delays due to the time it takes to prepare and launch rockets slows everything down. Any serious undertaking in space needs to address these issues before it does anything else. The road to profitability can be made much shorter thanks to proper design here.

  <h1>Colony Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>Go big, go robotic</summary>
   <p>
    Our position is it doesn't make sense to undertake construction or any industrial process on the Moon unless it can be done by robots that are operated remotely. Also, once a base is being built of lunar materials, it should be as big as possible. Most things should be made as large as they reasonably can be, until transport between Earth and the Moon has become routine and the colonies are very well established. Redundancy and extra capacity tend to come in handy at an outpost. The kind of businesses the colony will pursue first also tend to benefit from economies of scale - real estate, heavy machinery manufacture, facilities for tourism, sports, and broadcasting.

  <h1>Socio-Economic Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>A bridge to a new era</summary>
   <p>Everything here is predicated on the idea that a group of nations decide together to colonize the Moon and devote the funds necessary to do so properly without question. So, let the model be that the first missions are funded and carried out jointly by the nations with well-established space agencies - the United States, Russia, the European Union, China, India, Japan, and Canada. Once the Residence Program (explained below) begins, all nations participate.

  <h5><a href="machines2.html#ionDrive">Ion Drive Cargo Ship</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>This will require on-orbit assembly.
    <ul>
    <li>The assistance of the ISS or its successor is therefore vital.</li>
    <li>It will thus be able to ignore the restrictions of rocket fairings, unlike previous space ships. The finished ship will look like a giant wine rack with motors and solar panels tacked onto it.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>It has a set of spaces where cargo pods can be slid in and locked into place, similar to shipping container systems.</li>
   <li>Ongoing support from a space station is also needed, as a staging area where cargo pods can be sent, wait for the return of the cargo ship, and be loaded onto it by robotic arms and the station crew. This also means the cargo ship can receive maintenance and repairs, and be upgraded with more engines and cargo space.</li>
   <li>It is an uncrewed ship, as it takes far too long to move between Earth and the Moon to be safe or practical for people.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5><a href="machines2.html#nuclearShuttles">Nuclear Thermal Shuttles</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Flies between the lunar surface and lunar orbit</li>
   <li>May be practical to connect its engines to turbine generators when not flying</li>
   <li>Uses an <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#lantr">oxygen 'afterburner'</a> to increase thrust during launch and landing</li>
   <li>A barrier needs to be between the shuttle and human habs so that people aren't exposed to its radiation when working outside</li>
   <li>To design the model, better data is needed on radiation shield design. </li>
  </ul>

  <h5><a href="machines.html#robots">Robot and Rover Test Missions</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>After the cargo ship has deployed the nuclear shuttle, and the two have taken the first deliveries of equipment and supplies to the base site on the rim of Peary crater, a crew is delivered to orbit by a conventional rocket. Their capsule is picked up by the nuclear shuttle and landed at the base site.
  </li>
  <li>Remotely operated equipment has already excavated a trench, placed an inflatable hab for the crew in it, and covered it over with enough regolith to form a good radiation barrier. If there were problems with this process, the human crew completes it. Other simple processes such as basic scouting and solar panel setup were done.
  </li>
  <li>The crew spends a few weeks on site:
   <ul>
    <li>Surveying the locale, doing experiments on the soil and samples from the permanently shadowed craters</li>
    <li>Testing the prototype robots that will be used for more complex remote work after the crew leaves, and setting up initial infrastructure for them, such as rails they move on, bases for arms, stations for basic repairs and installaation of drop-in replacement parts.</li>
    <li>Assisting the remote operation equipment in the initial micro-charge excavation for the first constructed hab, and the initial testing of fabrication of building materials from melted regolith</li>
    <li>After the crew leave, a further series of missions uses that infrastructure so improved robots can be tested and do work.</li>
   </ul>
  <li>One or two additional crew expeditions may be sent as needed to help the robots build the first permanent hab, or do the initial small-scale collection and processing of ices from the permanent shadows. The emphasis is very much on the creation of equipment that can do that work without people on site, and completion of the first permanent hab.</li>
