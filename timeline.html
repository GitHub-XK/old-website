title: Timeline for Lunar Colonization
description: Events leading to colonization of the Moon, steps taken for profitable lunar industry, and the foundation of a lunar society.
headline: The Path to a Lunar Society
intro: What matters is understanding what <i>needs</i> to happen, and what <i>can</i> happen. The dates aren't important. Nothing determines the dates more than the priority the people of the space-faring nations place on this goal. This page explains the best conceivable path if the will is there and the politics of conflict is set aside. If we were really aware of what amazing things we could achieve if only we worked together, perhaps we would find the will to do so. Take what follows as an illustration of what that could be.

  <h1>Transport Systems</h1>
  <details>
  <summary>The key to success</summary>
   <p>
    Europeans colonized the world thanks to their great sailing ships. Railroads were vital to expansion across the North American continent. Almost any level of investment is justfied if it secures you access long-term to a large enough place. When that new place is the rest of the solar system? Bet the bank on it.
    The difference between reliance on chemical rockets and reliance on the system below is like the difference between wagon trains and steam locomotives. Railroads completely changed what was possible, this is the same thing.
   </p>
   <p>The cost of transport is currently a high percentage of the total cost of space missions. Total loss of missions due to launch failure, engine failure in space, or landing failure is frequent. Long delays due to the time it takes to prepare and launch rockets slows everything down. Any serious undertaking in space needs to address these issues before it does anything else. The road to profitability can be made much shorter thanks to proper design here.

  <h1>Colony Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>Go big, go robotic</summary>
   <p>
    Our position is it doesn't make sense to undertake construction or any industrial process on the Moon unless it can be done by robots that are operated remotely. Also, once a base is being built of lunar materials, it should be as big as possible. Most things should be made as large as they reasonably can be, until transport between Earth and the Moon has become routine and the colonies are very well established. Redundancy and extra capacity tend to come in handy at an outpost. The kind of businesses the colony will pursue first also tend to benefit from economies of scale - real estate, heavy machinery manufacture, facilities for tourism, sports, and broadcasting.

  <h1>Socio-Economic Development</h1>
  <details>
   <summary>A bridge to a new era</summary>
   <p>Everything here is predicated on the idea that a group of nations decide together to colonize the Moon and devote the funds necessary to do so properly without question. So, let the model be that the first missions are funded and carried out jointly by the nations with well-established space agencies - the United States, Russia, the European Union, China, India, Japan, and Canada. Once the Residence Program (explained below) begins, all nations participate.

  <h5><a href="machines2.html#AsteroidAnchors">First Asteroid Retrieval Mission</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Based on the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/depssite/documents/webpage/deps_083266.pdf">ARM</a> mission design scaled by a factor of 10, aiming for an asteroid massing 7.5 metric kilotons</li>
   <li>This needs to launch first so it can get the asteroid to lunar orbit by the time the infrastructure to do something with it is ready.</li>
   <li>This asteroid will be the anchor for the first tether from lunar orbit to the lunar surface. Want a good reason to conduct the ARM mission? This is it.</li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#ionDrive">Ion Drive Asteroid Retrieval Ship</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>This will require on-orbit assembly due to the size of the solar panels and the scale of the bag that will enclose the asteroid. It can probably be done in 2 pieces.
   </li>
   <li>To work well its solar panels need to generate roughly 1 MW of power, and it needs an array of <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040139476.pdf">HiPEP ion drives</a>, The ISS panels generate about 100 KW, so 10 times that much. One might hope to get 15 N of thrust from such a system. </li>
   <li>The ship is reused to retrieve a series of asteroids over time. It may need some refurbishment but should be able to get the 5 asteroids for the complete lunar tether system, and then a bunch of asteroids for mining.</li>
 </ul>
  <h5><a href="machines2.html#nuclearShuttles">Nuclear Thermal Shuttles</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li>Flies between the lunar surface and lunar orbit</li>
   <li>May be practical to connect its engines to turbine generators when not flying</li>
   <li>Uses an <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#lantr">oxygen 'afterburner'</a> to increase thrust during launch and landing</li>
   <li>A barrier needs to be between the shuttle and human habs so that people aren't exposed to its radiation when working outside</li>
   <li>To design the model, better data is needed on radiation shield design. </li>
  </ul>
 <h5><a href="machines2.html#CargoShip">Cargo Ship from LEO to LLO</a></h5>
 <ul>
  <li>uses next generation hydrolox upper stages capable of many restarts</li>
  <li>On the LEO end, it meets a space station, loads the cargo waiting there and gets servicing</li>
  <li>On the LLO end, it hands off its load to the nuclear shuttle</li>

 <article class="column">
  <h5><a href="machines.html#robots">Robot and Rover Test Missions</a></h5>
<p>These can't start until the cargo ship and shuttle are running and have delivered their first payload to the site of the future base. The goal would be to have robotic machinery on the surface capable of performing the complex work of construction and volatile extraction by the time the asteroid for the first tether arrives in orbit.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>After the cargo ship has deployed the nuclear shuttle, and the two have taken the first deliveries of equipment and supplies to the base site on the rim of Peary crater, a crew is delivered to orbit by a conventional rocket. Their capsule is picked up by the nuclear shuttle and landed at the base site.
  </li>
  <li>Remotely operated equipment has already excavated a trench, placed an inflatable hab for the crew in it, and covered it over with enough regolith to form a good radiation barrier. If there were problems with this process, the human crew completes it. Other simple processes such as basic scouting and solar panel setup are done.
  </li>
  <li>The crew spends a few weeks on site:
   <ul>
    <li>Surveying the locale, doing experiments on the soil and samples from the permanently shadowed craters</li>
    <li>Testing the prototype robots that will be used for more complex remote work after the crew leaves, and setting up initial infrastructure for them, such as rails they move on, bases for arms, stations for basic repairs and installaation of drop-in replacement parts.</li>
    <li>Assisting the remote operation equipment in the initial micro-charge excavation for the first constructed hab, and the initial testing of fabrication of building materials from melted regolith</li>
    <li>After the crew leave, a further series of missions uses that infrastructure so improved robots can be tested and do work.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One or two additional crew expeditions may be sent if needed to complete the design and testing of the robotic equipment. The robots must be capable of doing all the complex tasks of construction, excavation, extraction of volatile ices, and miscellaneous duties, by remote operation from Earth. The emphasis is very much on the creation of equipment that can do that work without people on site. Further missions to that end would also be of relatively short duration, on the order of a few weeks.</li>

  <h5>Creation of an international space agency body</h5>
  <p>The agencies of most of the major space-faring nations cooperated in the construction of the International Space Station: ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos, NASA, and CSA. This is the best precedent but is a minor collaboration compared to what would be involved in settling the Moon.</p>
  <p>Many questions of jurisdiction, ownership, information sharing, and legal responsibility would need to be settled. Again the agreements covering the ISS are the model that would need to be built on.</p>
  <p>A shift to an open-source model regarding the technology developed for the project could reduce tensions on several of those issues. The application of international law might help in questions of  administration.</p>
  <p>As the project would be underway for a number of years before it involved a permanent human settlement, and a number of years more before there was profit, the scale of cooperation needed to continue working together would only slowly need to grow, and be tested many times before issues of serious consequence needed to be settled.</p>
  <p>For this reason, such an endeavor provides the ideal way to develop the broad international collaboration needed to address long-term peace and prosperity on Earth.</p>
