This is where one of the highest concentrations of thorium detected on the Moon is. 
The map at right by the Lunar Prospector marks hotspots of it in white. 
Where there is thorium, there is KREEP - Potassium, Rare Earth Elements, and Phosphorus. 
Most of the Moon has only traces of K and P, even less of REE. K and P are necessary for plant growth.
The rare earth elements neodymium and samarium are used for making high-strength magnets - which in 0.16 g could do lots of neat stuff. 
Thorium can be processed into fuel for nuclear rocket engines.

As with all other sites that were considered, this site is on the 'shore' of a basalt mare. Both mare and highland materials 
are in the immediate vicinity. Unlike the other sites, this very young crater very probably punched through both materials. 
Bedrock of both mineralogies should be within easy reach, relatively speaking.

About another 100 km north is the equator. Something in a near equatorial orbit would be accessible to 
Lalande a few times a day - like an upper stage full of fuel that would allow the payload launched from the surface to be much larger. 
Things at the poles have that kind of access as well, to things in a polar orbit, but an upper stage would only 
be aligned with the direction of the Moon's orbit every two weeks, so launch windows to Earth would only be near 
those times. Things in other places 
have to deal with plane changes and orbital dynamics that requires more fuel and far fewer rendezvous opportunities 
than the poles or the equator.

Here is a collection of especially large boulders, 10 to 30 m across above the surface. They are all partially submerged so 
some will be larger below the surface. 
Boulders are much more common near the lips of 
craters. They were created by the impact blast, thrown high up then came down close by. 
Because Lalande is a young crater, they haven't been buried by 
dust. Boulders are useful as thermal mass, anchors, counterweights, 
and radiation shielding. Some could be bedrock from 3 km below the surface, 
so they could be made of just one or two minerals and be good feedstock for refining processes.

Case in point - the boulders with the especially long shadows just left of the 
marker. They are huge, the size of barns. They are so useful, the first phase of 
the initial base will go here, nestled against them. The first habitats will 
use them as thermal mass. Rovers can anchor themselves 
to them so they can apply force without tipping, or drag themselves out of a spot if they get stuck.

Here is a fresh crater, right beside Lalande which is also a fresh crater. 
It is a good size to be interesting for future plans - 300 m across - 
and in the right place - 150 m from Lalande. 
Once the colony is really growing, there are some 
neat things you can do here. It is a great place to test 
construction of geodesic water domes that would be 6 m of water sandwiched between 
laminated quartz. Construction of such domes is what will make true cities possible in the 
long term. But that takes a lot of infrastructure, so it will be presented as part of later phases.

This hill is the beginning of the highlands, the light areas on the Moon's 
surface. They are much older than the dark areas, the maria, which were created 
during great impacts that released so much lava from the Moon's interior it formed seas.
The highlands are made mostly of anorthosite, a class of minerals that don't 
have the qualities that make basalt such a good construction material.  
Some minerals here could be good ore for production of aluminum, glass, quartz, or sapphire.

The bits poking out furthest from the crater wall are just emerging from shadow in this shot. 
The sun was 37&deg; above the horizon at this moment, so the angle of the crater wall must be 
just about the same - and just a little steeper in this puddle of black the marker is on top of. 
Let's say 40% here. This is a good, steep, long grade. Not very common on the Moon.

This crater has a soft rim and no floor, the incline of its sides just meet. 
That may indicate the top layer of granular regolith is deeper than it is, so over 40 m. 
Recent modeling has shown the ground sort of folds back on itself on the lips of craters, which 
would make the granular layer twice the depth it had before. It could be 100 m deep.

This looks like bedrock. Up close, there is surely a layer of moondust over it, but thanks to the angle, not a lot. 
We can hope for meter or so, easily dug away on a grade like this. In bedrock, you find minerals much purer 
than the regolith on the surface. It hasn't been mixed over the aeons by meteor impacts that toss 
particles all over the planet. On the Moon, minerals could come in layers, not veins like 
on Earth. If you find a layer of rich ore, it could extend over a large area. Around here the 
jackpot would be layers highly concentrated in KREEP minerals and thorium.

There is a skylight in this area. The three images show it in the mid-afternoon, morning, and at midday. 
It is about 10 m by 20 m wide, and based on the sun angle when the left shot was taken, 
where the sun hits the floor of it indicates it is roughly 7 m deep. If you follow the link above to Lalande and find it,
you'll see there are spidery creases in the surface of the crater floor around it that suggest 
<i>maybe</i> that skylight leads to a tunnel, and there are others nearby. In fact, the whole floor of 
Lalande is covered with wrinkles and canyons highly suggestive of there being a lot of voids under its surface.

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="img/lal-lava-tube1.jpg" alt="possible lava tube">
Here is an example of the same phenomenon as #15, much closer to Cernan's Promise. 
These are called lava tubes, because they were made as the lava produced by the meteor 
impact that created Lalande cooled. Or at least, these mostly look like lava <i>cracks</i>, 
but the one on the left could be covering over a tube, perhaps. If so, it is quite long, but 
it looks like it could be too narrow to be useful as a ready-made structure. Others might be wide enough though. After 
the creation impact, a lot of lava settled on the floor, material that was heated to molten 
by the energy released. For a crater the size of Lalande, the melt pool would have reached about 500 m deep. The question is, how 
deep into it do these voids exist?

				<button class="numbers tooltipR" style="top: 50%; left: 39%;">17

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="img/lal-lava-tube2.jpg">
These fissures go all the way from the base of the crater wall to the hill to the left 
of the marker, about 2 km. Again, there are many examples like this around the crater 
floor, and many long depressions that are wider but without cracks or fissures. 
The lava of the melt pool was of low viscosity and flowed easily. So why isn't the floor 
of the crater flat, other than occasional prominences sticking out of it?  As it cooled, some areas 
crystallized before others. This took long enough that later events such as new impacts or 
moonquakes caused the liquid material to shift. Based on how wrinkly and bumpy the floor is, 
there might be voids deeper down that remain sealed.

On either side of the marker are the domes shown in the picture. They remind me of the 
bubbles that appear on the surface of batter or cans of paint. It makes me think of 
lighter lava pushing up here and getting trapped by a skin of lava that has cooled more and 
is thicker. What if some of that later drained away? That would leave a hollow dome. 
Wouldn't that be nice? Each one of these is 200 m across. What if, just maybe, the domes were created by bubbles of gas?

These hills mark the central upwelling that occurs in craters of this size as the 
ground rebounds after their creation impacts. They have a lot of boulders on top of them 
much darker than surrounding material. In this shot at midday the contrast is stark, it is less 
noticeable in images where the sun wasn't almost right behind the camera. Kepler and Aristarchus 
have this phenomenon too, to a lesser degree. Pockets of light material are usually explained as 
being material that was recently exposed and thus has weathered less. Such 
material reflects more light. Hard to fit that with the light stuff here, though. 
Dark material? No explanation i know of. Could be volcanic glass (obsidian), but the fragments are awfully large for that explanation.

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="img/blackLalande.jpg" alt="black material in Lalande crater">
Okay, there is one very tantalizing possible explanation, though it is very preliminary. 
If the asteroid that impacted here and created Lalande was moving slowly enough, 
much of its material may have remained here, instead of vaporizing and being distributed all 
over the Moon, which is what usually happens. So, if that asteroid was a chondrite (which are dark like this) these rocks 
could have a lot of pure metals in them, especially iron and nickel. If we were especially 
lucky, these could be the remains of a carbonaceous chondrite, containing large quantities of 
organic molecules hinting at the secrets of the origins of the solar system and life itself. 
Excellent for creating fertile soil and such too. What a score that would be.

A clear picture of the long-term result is necessary if people are to make a huge investment in something. 
Therefore we shall start with a model of Cernan's Promise with a population of several hundred people, 
representing the best-case scenario of what could be done in the next few decades. This time scale is relevant to the 
lives of most people and so that model will have the most influence. A close look at the best scenario is also 
well worth it as a way to put the things that hold us back in perspective. To create this best case 
we would need to overcome irrational fears and pointless divisions, and motivation to do that can come out of a 
good example of how much more we could do that way. The design is firmly based on a realistic development path, 
but the steps of that, for now, won't be explicitly documented in the VMC. Many of the pieces used in construction 
will be shown, though, and all support infrastructure.
		 	</p>
		 	<p>
The design is based on the primary income being residency, broadcasting, and tourism initially, and space construction 
for various purposes later. The habitats are designed to be pleasant places to live for the rest of your life. 
Thus building on a large scale is done from the outset. 
This is made feasible through the use of tele-operated robotic machinery and the extensive use of fused and cast basalt.
		 	</p>
		 	<p> 
More importantly, it is made possible by a group of nations together devoting serious investment to the task 
- this situation is assumed by Moonwards. 
Maybe an example of a really fantastic project that is only possible by joining forces and using the resources freed up by not 
fighting, will convince people to finally properly pursue that goal. Maybe pursuing a fantastic project together creates 
bonds that lead to trust and then there is no desire to fight. Getting that feedback loop going would be a wonderful thing.

This shows the first two habitats finished and home to a crew of 30. Most of the interior hasn't been modeled but the main areas have 
been sketched into the first dugout and hall. This model has been done with lighting and materials that give a much better sense of 
what the space would be like, and it has been optimized so that it will run smoothly on most computers, including many tablets. 
(I don't recommend it on a phone.) If the scale seems pretty ambitious, well it is, but consider that 
			<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287512462_Advanced_Systems_Concept_for_Autonomous_Construction_and_Self-repair_of_Lunar_Surface_ISRU_Structures">this paper</a> 
by Haym Benaroya looked at using cast basalt as a building material, and by the figures he calculated for the energy needed to melt it, 
just one of the Fresnel lenses planned for the melt-in-place stations could melt a metric ton of it in about 3 hours. One of 
			<a href="http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/VG09-193.pdf">these things</a> 
that i've taken to calling sun guns, with a set of concave mirrors adding up to 50 m<sup>2</sup> could do it in about 8 hours. 
Use a sun gun to cut a trench around the area to be excavated, and to bore holes to place micro-charges of explosives, and 99% 
of the material can be loosened into manageable chunks the gantry crane can lift out. 
The construction technique is being steadily improved, but this seems pretty doable. It would just take experimentation on-site to 
refine it - and when has colonization ever been achieved without a ton of adaptation and innovation on-site?

This whole colony concept depends on basalt being used for a great many things, and on focused sunlight being used to process it.
The Melt-In-Place Station comes up on the first mission to test and refine 
how to make building materials out of the basalt dust all over the dark areas of the Moon.
In the vacuum of space this basalt feedstock will behave differently than such material on Earth, 
and it has a chemical make-up different than anything found here.It is absolutely free of hydrated minerals (with water molecules in their crystal structure) and organic chemicals, 
has a higher content of iron and titanium, and its chemicals are highly reduced (meaning they tend to have extra electrons). 
			<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_bases/LSBchapter07.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks&page=53">Analysis done on Earth</a> 
indicates that could mean basalt materials on the Moon would be a lot <i>stronger</i> than they are here. We won't know until we experiment there. At any rate, cast basalt on Earth performs well as a construction 
material, and all the processes proposed are based on its known properties here.

Here is the first venture into what could be done on the Moon once the scale necessary to build real towns exists. It extends the 
methods already outlined, and takes advantage of the terrain.

This is a chemical process that will probably be useful on the Moon, in this case for iron and water. A possible alternate approach to obtaining 
iron is to magnetically 
separate small particles high in iron using magnets, and then melting them down and skimming off the slag. The ilmenite approach would 
also require such a step but the feedstock might be much easier to obtain. And it creates the option of shipping only hydrogen from 
the poles instead of shipping water. That would save tremendously on the mass and thus the energy required for delivery, 
the most expensive element 
of the undertaking by far. Other approaches to this are being considered, and could displace this one. However, there will surely 
be a role for a unit of this kind, if not for this, then for processing of, say, aluminium.

The TESS, the Thermal Energy Storage System, is a centerpiece of this approach. It provides electricity generation both day and night. 
It isn't a very efficient system - 20% energy conversion 
is probably a decent estimate overall - but the fuel is free (sunlight), the system is highly durable, robust, easy to repair, 
and most components could be fabricated right on the Moon early in the days of a settlement. Plus it serves several 
additional important functions at the same time. It captures vapors of pure oxygen, and chemicals 
such as oxides of potassium, phosphorus, sulfur and sodium - all very useful. The pond of lava depleted in these chemicals can 
be partially drawn off at the end of the day and taken for further processing that is much simplified by that state. The 
lava could also optionally be used for construction.

		This is rough work, here to get the whole plan up on the website for evaluation. First is the dome for the long-range plan of 
		creating a city. The dome is quartz glass with 6 meters of water on top, and then another layer of quartz glass. That is for radiation 
		and micro-meteor protection. The net force is outwards once the dome is filled with air, so the blue towers hold the dome down. At the 
		same time, the upward pull on the cables in the center of the towers is so great, full buildings can be built around them and the net force 
		would still be slightly upwards on those cables. The tension on them is about 1.5 million metric tons on each one.

		The second image shows the cables and framework. The mass of the glass and water isn't an issue once the dome is 
		filled with air, if anything it helps hold in the air, rather than being a mass that has to be held up. The trick here is to build the 
		dome, so that it can be filled with air, so that mass is supported. I have thoughts about that, still working on it. Also, if there is a major 
		meteor strike or some other disaster, and atmosphere is lost, the dome has to remain stable. The cables between the towers and the dome outer 
		surface are there for that reason, and the towers need to be able to support all that mass if there is no air.

		And this is the full layout of the colony that will be built showing 'Phase 1'. The idea right now it is to show the full colony at two points 
		in time - when it has the stuff in the image below, and when the domed city is built. I did this to have a sense of where everything would go, and 
		how it would all work together. Call it a placeholder for now. I know it has no labels or anything, but it gives a sense of the scale. Everything 
		blue and green is a habitat, purple is domes, brown is industrial space.
