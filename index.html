					<h1>Realistic Lunar Colony, Coming Online</h1>
					<p>
This project is building a series of virtual colonies on the Moon. They will be
richly detailed and interactive presentations that are entirely
plausible, technically and scientifically.
They will examine all the questions, consider all the implications. When humanity
undertakes ventures on the scale of space settlement, it matters a great deal
how many people have given it real thought beforehand. These colonies serve
that purpose.
	</p>
	<p>
The first colony created will show a full town with a population of 20,000.
It will have developed industries and facilities, spacious beautiful
architecture, transport systems moving high volumes of people and cargo around
the Moon and the solar system. It shows what happens just beyond the tipping
point, when technology enables a space boom. To evaluate the importance of
space exploration, this is the stage that must be understood.
</p>
<p>
	The next two colonies work outwards from there... forwards to the city that
grows from the town, when technology allows a segmented glass dome to be placed over
a crater 22 km across, becoming home to a million people... and backwards to
the first missions that develop the basic techniques and infrastructure that
make it all possible.
</p>
<p>
	These environments will be places to explore, create, collaborate, tell stories,
and above all to learn and to contemplate our future. To that end, the project
assumes an ideal political environment, in which a broad alliance of countries
pursues lunar settlement with determination and vision, making the best
technical decisions and investing as much as it takes to do it properly. In this
way the project can educate regarding the real gamut of options before us,
and the complete scope of such a vast endeavor.
</p>
<p>
	The entire project will always be open source, free of copyright, and free of
charge. In this way, as long as it has a strong core
framework, it has incredible potential for growth. Some virtual world project
along these lines is going to explode in the near future. The time is right.
Once a world is vivid enough, and provides the right tools, it will mushroom
as talented people see the potential and dive in. Never have there
existed ways for so very many people to collaborate so powerfully.
Moonwards can reach towards two final frontiers -
the one above our heads, and the one inside our heads. Let us see how powerful
vision can be.
</p>
<p>
	All the project's files are on the <a href="https://github.com/briligg/moonwards">
GitHub repository of Moonwards</a>. It is at
an early stage. It will always be 'under construction', though - that's its
nature. You will see this revamped website filling out in the coming weeks,
and then get new content regularly as the project advances. The same
will happen to the repo, after that. You will see the models changing and new
models being added, animated, and supplemented with other media.
When the first, simple version of the virtual colony comes online, then we are
really rolling. If you are
inclined to take part, please contact me, comment in one of the sections
provided, or use the other contact
options shown on the <a href="project.html">Project</a> page.
