						This is where one of the highest concentrations of thorium detected on the Moon is. 
						The map at right by the Lunar Prospector marks hotspots of it in white. Where 
						there is thorium, there is KREEP - Potassium, 
						Rare Earth Elements, and Phosphorus. 
						Most of the Moon has only traces of K and P, even less of REE. 
						K and P are necessary for 
						plant growth.
						The rare earth elements neodymium and 
						samarium are used for making high-strength magnets - which in 0.16 g could do lots of neat stuff. 
						Thorium can be processed into fuel for nuclear rocket engines.

						<span>As with all other sites that were considered, this site is on the 'shore' of a basalt mare. Both mare

						Bedrock of both mineralogies should be within easy reach, relatively speaking.

							Boulders are much more common near the lips of 
							craters because they are created by the blast of the impact, thrown high 
							into the - uh, where the air would be if it existed - and many come down 
							close by. 
							And because Lalande is a young crater, they haven't been buried by

						the initial base will go here, nestled against them. Their stability and height 
						allow the use of a gantry crane, and provide a firm anchor for cables so

						It is a good size to be interesting for future plans - 300 m across -

						Once the colony is really growing, there are some 
						neat things you can do here. Excavate a channel between it and Lalande, 
						and cover the entire crater with a geodesic dome. But that takes a lot of 
						infrastructure, so it will be part of later phases of construction.  
						It gets a name too. Teacup Crater.

						And here's Teacup Crater. To its right you can faintly see a line where the raised ground by the 
						crater rim stops, and flatter ground begins. 
						Hopefully that would be an adequate landing spot for the first missions. 
						It has a soft rim and no floor, the incline of its sides just meet. 
						That may indicate the top layer of granular regolith is deeper than it is, so over 40 m. 
						Recent modelling has shown the ground sort of folds back on itself on the lips of craters, which 
						would make the granular layer twice the depth it had before.

						<span>This looks like bedrock. Up close, there is surely a layer of moondust over it, but not a lot. 
						Maybe a meter or so, easily dug away on a grade like this. In bedrock, you find minerals much purer 
						than the regolith on the surface. It hasn't been mixed over the aeons by meteor impacts that toss 
						particles all over the planet. On the Moon, minerals could come in layers, not veins like 
						on Earth. If you find a layer of rich ore, it could extend over a large area. Around here the

						There is a skylight in this area. The three images show it in the mid-afternoon, morning, and at 
						midday. It is about 10 m by 20 m wide, and based on the sun angle when the left shot was taken, 
						where the sun hits the floor of it indicates it is roughly 7 m deep. If you follow the link above 
						to Lalande and find it,
						you'll see there are spidery creases in the surface of the crater floor around it that suggest 
						<i>maybe</i> that skylight leads to a tunnel, and there are others nearby. In fact, the whole floor of 
						Lalande is covered with wrinkles and canyons highly suggestive of there being a lot of voids under 
						its surface.

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="http://moonwards.com/img/lal-lava-tube1.jpg" alt="possible lava tube">
						Here is an example of the same phenomenon as #15, much closer to Cernan's Promise. 
						These are called lava tubes, because they were made as the lava produced by the meteor 
						impact that created Lalande cooled. Or at least, these mostly look like lava <i>cracks</i>, 
						but the one on the left could be covering over a tube, perhaps. If so, it is quite long, but 
						it looks like it could be too narrow to be useful as a ready-made structure. Others might be 
						wide enough though. After 
						the creation impact, a lot of lava settled on the floor, material that was heated to molten 
						by the energy released. For a crater the 
						size of Lalande, the melt pool would have reached about 500 m deep. The question is, how 
						deep into it do these voids exist?

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="http://moonwards.com/img/lal-lava-tube2.jpg">
						These fissures go all the way from the base of the crater wall to the hill to the left 
						of the marker, about 2 km. Again, there are many examples like this around the crater 
						floor, and many long depressions that are wider but without cracks or fissures. 
						The lava of the melt pool was of low viscosity and flowed easily. So why isn't the floor 
						of the crater flat, other than occasional prominences sticking out of it?  As it cooled, some areas 
						crystallized before others. This took long enough that later events such as new impacts or 
						moonquakes caused the liquid material to shift. Based on how wrinkly and bumpy the floor is, 
						there might be voids deeper down that remain sealed.

						On either side of the marker are the domes shown in the picture. They remind me of the 
						bubbles that appear on the surface of batter or cans of paint. It makes me think of 
						lighter lava pushing up here and getting trapped by a skin of lava that has cooled more and 
						is thicker. What if some of that later drained away? That would leave a hollow dome. 
						Wouldn't that be nice? Each one of these is 200 m across. What if, just maybe, the domes 
						were created by bubbles of gas?

						These hills, which mark the central upwelling that occurs in craters of this size as the 
						ground rebounds after their creation impacts, have a lot of boulders on top of them 
						much darker than surrounding material. In this shot at midday the contrast is stark, it is less 
						noticeable in images where the sun wasn't almost right behind the camera. Kepler and Aristarchus 
						have this phenomenon too, to a lesser degree. Pockets of light material are usually explained as 
						being material that was recently exposed and thus has weathered less. Such 
						material reflects more light. Hard to fit that with the light stuff here, though. 
						Dark material? No explanation i know of. Could be volcanic glass (obsidian), but the fragments 
						are awfully large for that explanation.

						<img class="tooltip-img" src="http://moonwards.com/img/blackLalande.jpg" alt="black material in Lalande crater">
						Okay, there is one very tantalizing possible explanation, though it is very 
						preliminary. If the asteroid that impacted here and created Lalande was moving slowly enough, 
						much of its material may have remained here, instead of vaporizing and being distributed all 
						over the Moon, which is what usually happens. So, if that asteroid was a  
						chondrite (which are dark like this) these rocks 
						could have a lot of pure metals in them, especially iron and nickel. If we were especially 
						lucky, these could be the remains of a carbonaceous chondrite, containing large quantities of 
						organic molecules hinting at the secrets of the origins of the solar system and life itself. 
						Excellent for creating fertile soil and such too. What a score that would be.

		 	<p>A clear picture of the long-term result is necessary if people are to make a huge investment in something. 
		 	Therefore we shall start with a model of Cernan's Promise with a population of several hundred people, 
		 	representing the best-case scenario of what could be done in the next few decades. This time scale is relevant to the 
		 	lives of most people and so that model will have the most influence. A close look at the best scenario is also 
		 	well worth it as a way to put the things that hold us back in perspective. To create this best case 
		 	we would need to overcome irrational fears and pointless divisions, and motivation to do that can come out of a 
		 	good example of how much more we could do that way. The design is firmly based on a realistic development path, 
		 	but the steps of that, for now, won't be explicitly documented in the VMC. Many of the pieces used in construction 
		 	will be shown, though, and all support infrastructure.
		 	</p>
		 	<p>
		 	The design is based on the primary income being residency, broadcasting, and tourism initially, and space construction 
		 	for various purposes later. The habitats are designed to be pleasant places to live for the rest of your life. 
		 	Thus building on a large scale is done from the outset. 
		 	This is made feasible through the use of tele-operated robotic machinery and the extensive use of fused and cast basalt.

						This whole colony concept depends on basalt being used for a great many things, and on focused sunlight being used to process it. The Melt-In-Place Station comes up on the first mission to test and refine 
						how to make building materials out of the basalt dust all over the dark areas of the Moon. In the vacuum of space this basalt feedstock will behave differently than such material on Earth,

						has a higher content of iron and titanium, and its chemicals are highly reduced (meaning they tend to have extra electrons). Analysis done on Earth indicates that could mean basalt 
						materials on the Moon would be a lot <i>stronger</i> than they are here. We won't know until we experiment there. At any rate, cast basalt on Earth performs well as a construction

					This sketch is even more sketchy than the others, more of a schematic really. Basalt rope and cloth are strong and durable here on

					Here is the first venture into what could be done on the Moon once the scale necessary to build real towns exists. It is bold, but it is

					this kind of structure wasn't what would come of it down the road. Later the construction method that will create it will be explored. 
					The method has been optimized as much as possible. It relies on concentrated sunlight applied directly to the regolith to create 
					trenches and anchor points, micro-charges of explosives to break up the ground for excavation, and the use of molten basalt 
					and basalt cable and cloth to create the walls, storeys, supports, and most furnishings.

					This is a chemical process that will probably be useful on the Moon. A possible alternate approach to obtaining iron is to magnetically 
					separate small particles high in iron using magnets, and then melting them down and skimming off the slag. The ilmenite approach would 
					also require such a step but the feedstock might be much easier to obtain. And it creates the option of shipping only hydrogen from 
					the poles instead of shipping water. That would save tremendously on the mass and thus the energy required for delivery, 
					the most expensive element 
					of the undertaking by far. Other approaches to this are being considered, and could displace this one. However, there will surely

						The sun is where it really is during mid-morning. The rim of Lalande actually

						20 m high. The mound supporting the other end of the gantry crane is 
						about 15 m high. Right now the rocks that have been modelled are all shown 
						as bumps and mounds, but they are all boulders with much sharper angles. All 
						the blotches you see are boulders too - they just haven't been modelled as such 
						because there are so many. The fuzzy patches on the face of Lalande - more 
						boulders, all that stuff. This area is lousy with boulders and rocks. 
						With a little luck, a few of them will be chunks of bedrock of one pure mineral. 
						Ilmenite would be nice. If a molten metal oxide electrolysis system was set up, 
						lunar ilmenite, which is mostly oxides of iron and titanium, could be used to produce 
						oxygen, iron and titanium. Based on the composition of the regolith in the area

						Down on the crater floor the lunar day is shortened by more than 2 Earth days. The rim is 
						the best place to put anything that relies on the sun, and that includes many things 
						planned for this base. 
						The grade inside the rim is about 40<sup>o</sup>, and the surface is covered in rocks, 
						pebbles and boulders. It is nasty terrain to send a rover into. So the rovers will 
						have a cable attached to them, going to a large winch bolted to Gibraltar. If they get in

	 				Here is the crane-bot: some robotic arms with cameras and manipulators 
	 				('hands', basically) tele-operated from 
	 		Earth. I've just sketched something in for now, but this is really important. 
	 		Tough, powerful, and sensitive robotics suitable for 
	 		the Moon environment almost exist, and that makes everything else here viable. 
	 		Once the VMC is more developed, all stations 
	 		will be shown with the mounts where robonauts (movable robotic 'torsos' in this case) 
	 		could latch on and connect to power and data feeds, and work 
	 		on the task at hand. In this initial phase, the base has rovers with lots of robotic agility. 
	 		They or the crane can move the robonauts from station to 
	 		station or make use of them themselves for supplementary capability. Modular tool kits could 
	 		be used by any robot. 
	 		Building in this way means payload is all machinery and hardware, without any mass put 
	 		towards food, life support, 
	 		or safety. Nothing needs to return, so you save the mass of an entire ascent stage. 
	 		In fact, the rocket that gets everything 
	 		to the surface can then be torn apart for materials. 
	 		This is the biggest thing that changes the economics of the 
	 		endeavor, besides perhaps the possibility of reusable launchers.

	 			Here is the solar furnace. The half-bowl parabolic mirror has a radius of 15 m. 
	 			The mirror doesn't need to be really exact - 
	 			the tank at its focal point is large enough that small errors in its 
	 			curvature won't cause reflected light to miss it. And although it is quite big and has the shade rectangle 
	 			on one side (the thing tacked onto its left side) it isn't very heavy.

	 			The shade rectangle is a bit hard to see (it reflects only the black sky from this angle). 
	 			It is several layers of highly reflective material, 
	 			each layer separated by a small 
	 			gap. In the vacuum of space, this is the best system for insulation. Sunlight never hits all the 
	 			gear connected to the furnace tank because it hits this first and ~92% of 
	 			it reflects off it back into space. What is absorbed heats the 
	 			material of the top layer, which then starts to radiate that heat back into space in random directions, 
	 			so roughly half hits the layer below, which reflects ~92% but also heats due to that portion 
	 			it absorbs and starts randomly radiating
	 			that into space, so ~50% hits the layer after that, and so on. 
	 			In space there is no heat transfer due to convection or conduction, because there is no air, so this 
	 			kind of insulation is very effective. It protects the oxygen storage high-pressure cylinder 
	 			underneath it from sunlight all through the day. The cooler the gas is the less pressure it 
	 			exerts, so this enhances its capacity. It is also angled so that infra-red 
	 			radiation coming from the oxygen tank and its compressor are reflected skywards, 
	 			passively cooling them just a little.

	 				This is the melt-in-place bed - the MIP. 
	 				It arrives on the first mission. The techniques for working with melted basalt 
	 				will be developed here. It can use any regolith feedstock made of small grains, 
	 				which melt quickly. 
	 				The crane and rovers deliver that after screening to eliminate  
	 				chunks larger than 2 or 3 mm.
	 				In this region the regolith on the surface should be basalt, which is ideal. 
	 				Lunar basalt is really runny when fully melted, and crystallizes quickly as it cools. 
	 				With the right process it can be made 
	 				strong in both tension and compression. Near its freezing temperature 
	 				it is thick and gooey, suitable for use like plaster or glue.
	 				It should be possible to learn enough processes during Mission 1
	 				for this station to produce supports for  the solar furnace, crane, and basalt thread production 
	 				stations, saving considerable payload mass on Mission 2.

	 			A tungsten

	 			tungsten core - magnesia is plentiful on the Moon though it has to be refined, tungsten is quite rare. Once 
	 			magnesia can be produced, it can be used to patch the tank, and thus the tungsten should last a very long time. The

	 			Because they have condensed and crystallized in the chiller, they don't contaminate the oxygen that 
	 			passes through here. Conveniently, these compounds will boil off at temperatures below where oxygen 
	 			begins to separate in significant quantities, so by the time that oxygen starts passing through, they 
	 			will already have been captured. The gas that continues on to the condenser should be pretty pure

	 			Once the lava in the furnace tank has been processed as much as is useful, it is emptied into

	 			question. However much of its oxygen was successfully removed would leave behind atoms of 
	 			metal. Would they all recombine with other constituents as the lava cooled, or would some of that 
	 			metal remain elemental? How would it affect the properties of the material? Further processing of this 
	 			lava would be undertaken. The idea is it enters this vessel at above 2000 <sup>o</sup>C - more than 
	 			hot enough for numerous proposed processing methods. Basalt minerals 
	 			don't start to crystallize until 1500 <sup>o</sup>C. Perhaps if you take the lava straight to a centrifuge, 
	 			you can get the metal oxides in it to separate into layers and draw them off individually before 
	 			crystallization begins. Maybe you could even get a bit of pure metal that way, because the metal left 
	 			over by the release of oxygen won't combine to form minerals until crystallization begins. If that can 
	 			work, that would be fantastic. Purification of metals and metal oxides on the Moon is a really thorny 
	 			issue because feasible methods use multiple steps and chemicals that are rare or non-existent on the Moon, 
	 			or hydrogen, which is hard to store. If they could be gotten this way, many doors open.

	 				This is the basalt thread station. Basalt is melted and spun into thread on Earth to make very strong cloth 
	 		and cable. This is a sketch of a possible approach to the same thing on the Moon. 
	 		As on Earth, the lava flows out small holes arranged 
			around the bottom of a tank full of lava. At the right temperature, basalt lava has a very strong tendency to 
			form long strings, like molten glass does. Pull just right and those strings will keep flowing as continuous 
			strands, which can be twisted together and wound onto a spool. By sizing the tanks properly and putting the 
			right number of holes on the bottom, properly spaced out, dozens to hundreds of strands can be pulled from each, 
			for string and cord of different weights.  
			On the Moon the lava will cool more slowly because there is no air carrying heat away from it. 
			On the other hand, the low gravity means strands can hang over a much greater height without snapping under 
			their own weight. By using this to make thinner continuous strands that hang longer before being twisted 
			together, hopefully they can be cooled to the right temperature for this to work. If the process needs to be 
			more complex, it is still worth it. Being able to make cloth and cord on the Moon in large quantities would 
			open up many possibilities.

	 					This a very preliminary mock-up of basalt thread equipment. The small amount of related research 
	 					indicates that lunar basalt is thinner when liquid than basalt on Earth. One experiment was able to 
	 					easily draw long fibers from a simulant of lunar regolith, a second couldn't make usable fibers without 
	 					adding boric acid. Little can be said about how the real process will work without extensive experimentation 
	 					on the Moon. Likely factor: precise temperature control. A later model will propose a possible approach to 
	 					that. Finding the right feedstock will certainly also be important. Possibly it would help to do this 
	 					job in an air environment rather than in vacuum.

	 			This support tower has radiator panels extending from it 
	 			to cool refrigerant from the chiller. 
	 			Radiators work really well at high temperatures, so when the hot coolant exits the chiller circuit 
	 			it would go first to them. The hot coolant would wind back and forth through 
	 			them to have time to lose heat. The radiators don't have to cool much mass at one time, but they need to 
	 			drop its temperature by over 2000 <sup>o</sup>C. 
	 			During the day thier capacity is limited by the
	 			proximity of hot sun-baked ground, and sunlight, though they have been positioned to 
	 			minimize their direct exposure to 
	 			the sun. An option to protect them from the ground's heat would be more reflective insulation, but 
	 			in this case there is no configuration that wouldn't reflect heat back onto the radiators as well 
	 			as reflecting it away. So after the coolant temperature has dropped to near 100 <sup>o</sup>C, 
	 			the technique changes.

	 			After it wound through tubes on a route as long as possible in the rads, 
	 			the coolant would go into a trench dug into the ground and wind through another 
	 			long route there. The ground is 
	 			about -20 <sup>o</sup>C, so if most of the heat has already been shed, that should do nicely. 
	 			However, once you start adding heat to the ground, it won't stay -20 <sup>o</sup>C. A mass 
	 			of warmer soil will build up around the pipes in the trench. That won't do, so at night the 
	 			coolant would continue to be pumped so that heat is passed from the ground to the radiators and 
	 			removed again. So that means you need to keep this circuit as far from the 
	 			sunken hall as possible. Heating up the ground around the sunken hall will be done 
	 			actively. As long as this coolant circuit is far away, its impact on the heat island for 
	 			the hall (explained in #29) should be insignificant.

						This shows the massive shallow arches that will be laid across the dugout area. 
						(In cutaway here and not completely to scale 
						for better visibility.) They need to be about 4.5 m tall, 50 cm wide, and spaced 1 m apart. 
						Beyond that you can make them as long as you want (the length they span), and lay out as many 
						as you want to roof a dugout of any length. 
						They need to be solid basalt, preferably with a high content of iron and titanium (which 
						is widely available nearby). That's because these arches are a sneaky defense against 
						cosmic radiation that still allows a view of the sky and plenty of sunlight. 
						That is hugely beneficial psychologically and makes it much easier to grow plants. The 
						arch material needs to be dense so it stops galactic cosmic rays (really particles) better. 
						The dimensions here are based on a density of 
						3.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. If denser material was obtained, such as pure olivine or ilmenite, the 
						height of the arches could be reduced. 
						The blocks for the arches will be made by the MIPs, 
						each built up layer by layer, and lifted into place by the crane.

						Notice how the sunlight falls between the arches.
						They allow 2/3 of sunlight to enter the dugout space, but 
						you could spend half of all your time here and get a radiation dose safe for a 
						permanent resident - about 0.035 Sv/yr in this configuration. 
						Nuclear plant workers on Earth are permitted a maximum dose of 0.05 Sv/yr. 
						The dose from straight above you is quite high, 
						in the narrow corridor between arches, but off to the sides, the greater the angle the lower the 
						dose because an ever greater thickness of arches is between you and the outside. Here you have a 
						space where you can actually see the sky risk-free. If you have seen plans for Moon structures with 
						big windows or thin walls before, they were either ignoring the radiation problem or assuming stays 
						would be short. To live on the Moon, you need this kind of protection. 
						For solar flares, you'd need to retreat 
						into the hall. If sunlight is falling on you, you are in danger. But that is fine. 
						Flares are rare and you would be alerted of one's approach in 
						plenty of time. Enough time to move the potted plants into the hall, even.

						This arched opening in the regolith 
						is the beginning of the sunken hall. Over time it would be dug straight through 
						to the inner face of Lalande Crater, opening onto it with windows 
						(protected from radiation by an overhanging platform that has 
						loose regolith piled on top) for a panoramic view 
						of the crater floor. More images will presently be posted showing the construction process and 
						technique. Luckily, regolith is extremely stable when excavated, much more so than any soil on Earth. 
						This space will be reinforced with arches but the building process is aided by the ground's 
						stability. The laser-like heating power of the lenses will be used to score the regolith so it is 
						easier to break up and dig out. The digger rover will anchor itself to Gibraltar so it can claw into 
						the surface with full power without tipping in the low gravity.

						As sunlight fills the dugout, the ground deeper than 80 cm 
						is going to heat up for the first time in 100 million years. Over most of the Moon (except the poles), 
						heat doesn't move farther than that distance 
						over the course of each lunar day. Further than 80 cm underground is -20 <sup>o</sup>C all the time. 
						Because the Moon is bone dry, airless, and still, heat only diffuses. Nothing is actively carrying it away. 
						So a heat island will accumulate around the sunken hall. The cold ground is going to suck 
						up incoming heat which will steadily move away from the hall, but the further it goes, 
						the slower it goes because the heat gradient is ever less. As long as the heat is topped up 
						every day with more sunlight, the walls of the hall will stabilize at a new 
						warmer temperature determined by the natural size of that heat island and the amount of sunlight 
						received, and will vary from that only slightly each lunar day. 
						This temperature can be designed to be 21 <sup>o</sup>C. Tools: 
						Deep ditches around the hall perimeter 
						lined with reflective material. In vacuum little heat would cross such a barrier. Black floors where sun falls 
						to maximize absorption. Then just let in the right amount of sun. Remember the sun is 30 % stronger than 
						noonday tropical sun on Earth.
