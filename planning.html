			<p>
We're drafting a permanent colony home to about 250 permanent residents. The finished habs, installations, 
and equipment is what will be modeled, but everything has to be based on a well-defined, realistic approach that 
has the best possible technical merit and efficiency. So, even though the construction process won't be 
documented until later, it has to be carefully thought through and everything has to obey it. 
				<br><br>
The better this groundwork is done, the more quickly the project can expand. Habitats in a large lava tube 
and natural domes found on the floor of Lalande, and in a cave blasted out of the south face of the crater, 
a base at the north pole, an extensive high volume tether transport system, giant polar greenhouses, covering 
an entire 300 m crater with a dome of water and quartz, mining operations and manufacturing facilities, and 
covering over all of Lalande Crater in a transparent dome - these are all projects i would like to do. 
If this first phase is completed, as a true interactive virtual colony, these other phases can be undertaken. 
The first one is by far the hardest.

				<p><strong class="yellow">Infrastructure and Equipment:</strong> 
			 	To maximize the utility of a limited amount of machinery and supplies, these are the 
			 	design principles:
				</p>
				<ul class="roundAll dark" >
					<li><strong>Modular</strong>
 - Everything that can be shared around, will be. Design things that can be 
dropped quickly and easily into a number of machines for a quick repair, added capacity, or specialized ability. 
					</li>
					<li><strong>Light</strong>
 - Use not only materials with the best density and strength for the lightest 
design, but also always look for ways to use local materials - rocks and soil for stability, insulation, or 
thermal mass, for instance. Early missions are designed to create capacity to build elements that can be used 
this way. Simple structural elements like frames, tanks, and cables will be made on-site by the time the 2nd or 3rd payload of machinery arrives.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Simple</strong>
 - Low part count, simplest possible technology. Electric or mechanical actuators instead of 
hydraulic, for example. Design parts that can be replaced with parts fabricated on site where possible - 3d 
printed with sintered metal powder or made of fused basalt.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Feasible</strong>
 - Everything needs to be designed and developed, but don't use a technology 
unless there is high confidence it would be available to a real colony. It is reasonable to assume more agile 
and powerful robotics, for instance, but don't bet on fusion power. Make use of what has been created instead 
building something that requires different technology or duplicates the capacity of something already created. 
If you think there is a superior option, make the case, and maybe a whole element will be replaced if you are right. 
That is why the solar furnace was replaced by the TESS.

			 	<p><strong class="yellow">Habitats:</strong> This is a permanent colony. Build for growth and for the ages:
				</p>
				<ul class="roundAll dark">
			 		<li><strong>Low Radiation</strong>
 - The maximum annual dose for long-term lunar residents 
shall be taken as 0.05 Sv/year, which is the maximum dose permitted for nuclear plant workers. 
Values for cosmic radiation on the lunar surface are estimated only as adequate data is lacking. 
Taking currently used values, the maximum dose is not exceeded if 700 g/cm<sup>2</sup> of 
regolith is between people and the sky. There are many wrinkles to this, some of that 
is discussed as part of the radiation blind glazing design used over dugouts. In the most 
general terms, some values can be simplified. Time spent in areas shielded on all 
sides by at least 1000 g/cm<sup>2</sup> 
have doses low enough they need not be considered. Time spent outside in a space suit or vehicle 
shall for now be taken as an average value of 0.4 Sv/year in consideration of secondary radiation. 
When estimating the dose in an area, locate its center, and calculate what 
portion of the surface area of a sphere is exposed to the different dose levels within it. 
For instance, a window under an overhang with a view down into Lalande Crater 
will give a small radiation dose to people standing in front of it due to the 
secondary radiation cosmic rays create on the lunar surface. That would be significantly 
less than direct exposure, but still needs to be considered. But if that window is 
at the end of a sunken hall, most of that person's surroundings present them with no 
radiation dose, effectively. So, the expected dose from the direction of the window would 
be multiplied by whatever fraction of that sphere surface area it takes up for that person. 
When estimating overall dose, to get the true yearly dose, multiply the doses in different areas by 
the fraction of time spent there on average, and add the results for all areas. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>70% Earth Atmosphere</strong>
 - To reduce the burden on building structures, the atmosphere used can be 70% that on Earth, which is 10 psi, 70 kPa, or 700 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. 
Because the gravity is 1/6th of Earth's, it would take 6 times as much material to offset that 
pressure with sheer mass - 4200 g/cm<sup>2</sup> if it was pressing down from above. 
In cases such as windows, other glazing, and airlocks, the pressure must be contained entirely by materials under tension. 
Basalt cable and fabric can be used for this. Solid basalt materials built up 
layer by layer or cast from lava can also have good strength in tension if they are 
cooled to have a glass structure. In areas excavated out of packed regolith and rock, some portion of the pressure can be born by the ground. 
We don't have data as to how much, for cases where the 
shortest distance to the outside contains less than that 4200 g/cm<sup>2</sup> figure. Interiors of 
such areas are lined with basalt tiles and then parged with lava in current designs. Ceilings are 
reinforced with arches that may need to contain basalt cable in order to bear the tension load.
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Lots of Sun</strong>
 - People will live here long-term. Make it a pleasant place to be. 
Living in artificial lighting is depressing. There should be enough sunlight for most plants to grow, simply  
for comfort, as well as to have plants. Light received indirectly by reflection, windows that are 
recessed enough or have a large enough overhang to have no view of the sky, and radiation blind glazing are three options. 
Reflected light can use parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight so that lots can come in through a small opening. 
During solar flares, areas that receive sunlight directly - radiation blind glazed areas - will receive dangerous doses of radiation. 
A sheltered area must always be connected to such glazed areas so people and plants can be moved quickly to safety when a flare alarm occurs. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Thermal Mass</strong>
 - Noon is really hot, midnight is really, really cold. But the sun is only about 30% stronger than full sun on Earth, 
just without an atmosphere or water to hold and redistribute its heat. If you give it enough 
mass to soak into, temperatures will stay within a comfortable range with little to no heat control equipment. 
If enough sun to grow plants is admitted structures will require lots of such mass. 
The favored approach is design of heat islands. This is discussed further in the image set for sunken halls. 
Basically, once the way heat diffuses through the ground is understood, a heat budget can be designed 
for a structure of a given geometry. A balance needs to be struck between the amount of heat that 
will enter as sunlight or soak through structures not thermally isolated from the surface, 
the surface area within habitats that this heat is then distributed to, and the volume of material beyond them the heat will diffuse into. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Build Big</strong>
 - As big as possible. With the above requirements satisfied, the task is to 
figure out how to build a structure with the largest possible volume with available resources. For people 
living here, these buildings are both their indoors and their outdoors. We are assuming that people will 
venture out onto the surface of the Moon only very little. Since robots are being used to build the entire colony, 
it is probable that the vast majority of tasks could be efficiently accomplished by residents 
tele-operating those robots from within habitats. Especially if that system includes a quality virtual 
reality interface, people would tend to prefer that over putting on a bulky, uncomfortable spacesuit 
that restricts their mobility so much it makes them quite clumsy, and exposing themselves to high radiation outside. 
So very large open spaces are a critical element of habitat designs. Other than personal spaces 
such as homes and offices, which can benefit from a cozy feel, everything should be on a much bigger scale than on Earth. 
Ceilings should be at least 5 or 6 m high, halls extra wide, large open areas always nearby. 
A good starting point is the interior design of large shopping malls. 
		 			</li>
		 			<li><strong>Create Views</strong>
 - Though it comes last, this makes the list. Being in a restricted space is crazy-making. 
Windows must exist, but must be recessed or covered by an overhang in order to reduce radiation. 
Direct views of the sky are possible within areas with radiation blind glazed roofs. 
Views of the Earth should be spread through every hab, magnified where possible. Gardens need to be landscaped and have lots of different plants. 
While clutter and busy designs make spaces feel smaller, putting in a large number of small items that are very detailed gives a sense 
that the space contains more. Small figurines or models can be incorporated around doorways, shelves, 
and posts, and tucked among plants. Bas-reliefs in a single material would be effective, as their single 
color prevents them from making spaces feel cluttered, while the images add visual richness.
