# moonwards
Moonwards is a project to build a virtual lunar colony with the highest possible scientific and technological realism, and all the detail needed to make it feel real for a user. 
The colony's development will be traced from its origin to when the Moon is both independent and a major economic force. The goal is to bring space-faring alive in people's minds by showing them what it would be like through an intuitive medium. This is a prerequisite for considering the true importance of space exploration in the modern world. To bring home how great are the possibilities, how fundamentally different it is from our past, people need to have a feel for it.

The project needs people who can develop or vet colony designs for realism, create educational content for the website, build models in <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, and build the full world environment in a game engine. Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/briligg/moonwards/wiki) to see general approaches.
