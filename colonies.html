			<h1>The Colonies</h1>
			<p>To settle the Moon you have to find the right place, set up
			the right transport, and pursue the right business. All of these
			matters are open questions. Often the best options are ignored
			because it would be too expensive under current budgets, or there
			would be too much resistance from people who don't understand
			the risks and benefits of the technology involved. Consistent,
			ongoing high investment changes the possibilities and the best path.

				<h1>Lalande Crater: Young, Equatorial, Mineral-rich</h1>
				<p>
			The first virtual colony being built is a town beside Lalande Crater,
			population: 20,000. It is
			there because the region has the Moon's highest concentrations of
			potassium, phosphorus, and rare earth elements, including thorium. It also has
			among the highest levels of titanium and iron. It is on the shore of
			a lunar 'sea', so the minerals of both the highlands
			and the basalt seas are close by. Lastly,
			it is one of the Moon's youngest large craters, so bedrock is close to the
			surface, making it one of the very best places to get hold of pure minerals,
			instead of the powdered mixtures in the surface soil.
			<br><br>
			The premise is that the most
			important industry on the Moon will be construction, both for expansion of
			lunar colonies and for building things to send into space, such as spaceships,
			space stations, satellites, and orbiting tethers. Income from selling space
			infrastructure depends on the ability to
			fabricate large and complex items on industrial scales. Income from selling residence,
			tours, and broadcasting also depends on large pleasant facilities
			and habitats being erected. Both things require vast quantities of a variety
			of minerals, Lalande has top reserves of them all.
			<br><br>
			That makes it the best place to put the heavy industry that fabricates these
			things - what it lacks is relatively light and can be brought from the
			north pole or from asteroids mined in orbit.
			Its advantageous position at the equator for launch and landing makes it
			an excellent place for a large space port handling high volumes of cargo.
			There are also several neat tricks
			one can do in a young crater to create efficient, pleasant architecture.
			The big money is going to be at
			Lalande, so it has the first boom-town.
