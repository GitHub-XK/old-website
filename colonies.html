			<h1>The Colonies</h1>
			<p>To settle the Moon you have to find the right place, set up
			the right transport, and pursue the right business. All of these
			matters are open questions. Often the best options are ignored
			because it would be too expensive under current budgets, or there
			would be too much resistance from people who don't understand
			the risks and benefits of the technology involved. Consistent,
			ongoing high investment changes the possibilities and the best path.

				<h1>Lalande Crater: Young, Equatorial, Mineral-rich</h1>
				<p>
			The first virtual colony being built is a town beside Lalande Crater,
			population: 20,000. It is
			there because the region has the Moon's highest concentrations of
			potassium, phosphorus, and rare earth elements, including thorium. It also has
			among the highest levels of titanium and iron. It is on the shore of
			a lunar 'sea', so the minerals of both the highlands
			and the basalt seas are close by. Lastly,
			it is one of the Moon's youngest large craters, so bedrock is close to the
			surface, making it one of the very best places to get hold of pure minerals,
			instead of the powdered mixtures in the surface soil.
			<br><br>
			The premise is that the most
			important industry on the Moon will be construction, both for expansion of
			lunar colonies and for building things to send into space, such as spaceships,
			space stations, satellites, and orbiting tethers. Income from selling space
			infrastructure depends on the ability to
			fabricate large and complex items on industrial scales. Income from selling residence,
			tours, and broadcasting also depends on large pleasant facilities
			and habitats being erected. Both things require vast quantities of a variety
			of minerals, Lalande has top reserves of them all.
			<br><br>
			That makes it the best place to put the heavy industry that fabricates these
			things - what it lacks is relatively light and can be brought from the
			north pole or from asteroids mined in orbit.
			Its advantageous position at the equator for launch and landing makes it
			an excellent place for a large space port handling high volumes of cargo.
			There are also several neat tricks
			one can do in a young crater to create efficient, pleasant architecture.
			The big money is going to be at
			Lalande, so it has the first boom-town.

				<h1>Peary Crater: Water Inside, Eternal Sun Outide</h1>
				<p>
					Just a few years ago it was confirmed that in the deep constant
					shadow of the craters of the Moon's poles there is water. Plus a
					mix of other substances that were steamed out of the rest of the
					Moon eons ago - carbon dioxide, ammonia. There seem to be hundreds
					of millions of tons of it, perhaps billions. There ensued excitement
					about the new possibilities for settlement this creates - within a
					small community. Most of the world has already discarded the idea of
					settling the Moon and wants to press on to Mars, if they favor
					space settlement at all. We have fogotten the images of lunar bases
					and towns that were so common during the Apollo days.
				</p>
				<p>
					That small community noted that right beside those reserves of
					volatiles (being substances that are normally too volatile in the
					lunar environment to stick around), there are peaks on the crater
					rims that receive sunlight over 90% of the time. If you can raise
					solar panels on masts 30 m or so, in the right spots they would get
					sunlight virtually all the time. So you have solved energy and water,
					two really big challenges.
					<br><br>
					Thus most pushes for lunar bases these days focus on the poles. There
					is even a business model - turn the water into liquid hydrogen and
					liquid oxygen, and sell it as feul for satellites, deep space missions,
					and space stations. Unlike putting a base on Mars, this is a space
					program we could undertake quickly, it is much safer, and it has
					practical payoffs here at home - space refeuling would allow much
					more space exploration.
					<br><br>
					It has been repeatedly debated whether the base at Peary
					Crater should be the first priority, or the first missions should go
					to Lalande and expand to Peary from there. There are several reasons
					to doubt hydro-lox fuel production would be a
					good business in this paradigm. An orbital tether system,
					ion drive cargo ships, and nuclear shuttles are all part of this plan,
					which hugely cuts down the importance of local hydrolox.
					The water needs of Lalande in the early days could be provided from
					Earth. The choice of nuclear power plants negates the need
					for constant sun.
				</p>
				<p>
					On further investigation, a version of the construction technique
					planned for Lalande would work with the minerals found in the highlands,
					where the poles are. That means a large
					habitat like proposed for Lalande could be made at Peary, allowing
					the early research and development needed for the core business in this
					paradigm - construction - to be done there. The assertion is that
					construction is the best and fastest way to make a Moon settlement
					profitable, so it is quite significant to have a way to work at the
					pole on the core business, as well as volatile mining.
					In that case, the advantage
					of the machines not needing to deal with night also weighs in favor
					of going there first. So, now the idea is that a small settlement is
					made at Peary, and then the first crew sends machines to Lalande and
					makes the next hab.
					<br><br>
					The early robotic missions would focus on making
					the hab, not on volatile mining. It is much better for people to be
					nearby when undertaking something as tricky as extracting volatiles
					from one of the coldest places in the solar system. Since the focus
					is developing construction capability, the missions can take more
					time to perfect and ramp up production of water,
					carbon dioxide, and ammonia. At first the water that is obtained is
					only to supplement the fuel supply of the nuclear shuttles. Then it
					supplies their fuel entirely, and then the new colony has more and
					more freedom to use water for greenhouses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, Peary starts
					shipping water, carbon, and ammonia to Lalande in ever larger
					amounts. That water stays on the Moon, to make ponds, then swimming
					pools, then small lakes. Maybe some would ship to orbit for fuel,
					or radiation shielding. But
					there might be no need. By this time asteroids will be mined for
					water and metals and may be a better source for needs in open space.
