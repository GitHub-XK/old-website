intro: "To settle the Moon you have to find the right place, set up
the right transport, and pursue the right business. All of these
matters are open questions. Often the best options are ignored
because it would be too expensive under current budgets, or there
would be too much resistance from people who don't understand
the risks and benefits of the technology involved. Consistent,
ongoing high investment changes the possibilities and the best path."

					<h1>Lalande Crater: Young, Equatorial, Mineral-rich</h1>
					<p>
				The first virtual colony being built is a town beside Lalande Crater,
				population: 20,000. (It isn't the first colony on the timeline
    though, that's Peary.) It is
				there because the region has the Moon's highest concentrations of
				potassium, phosphorus, rare earth elements, and thorium. It also has
				among the highest levels of titanium and iron. It is on the shore of
				a lunar 'sea', so the minerals of both the highlands
				and the basalt seas are close by. Lastly,
				its sharp, detailed features indicate there is little
    regolith overlaid on its interior due to the blast debris of later impacts
    landing on it<sup class="note tooltip"
				data-tooltip-content="#noteLal1">
					[1]</sup>. Large portions of its lower slopes look to be solid rock
    just below the surface, and one such place is the long raised shelf
    1.5 km below the site of the colony, Cernan's Promise.
				<br><br>
				The premise is that the most
				important industry on the Moon will be construction, both for expansion of
				lunar colonies and for building things to send into space, such as spaceships,
				space stations, satellites, and orbiting tethers. Income from selling space
				infrastructure depends on the ability to
				fabricate large and complex items on industrial scales. Income from selling residence,
				tours, and broadcasting also depends on large pleasant facilities
				and habitats being erected. Both things require vast quantities of a variety
				of minerals, Lalande has top reserves of them all.
				<br><br>
				That makes it the best place to put the heavy industry that fabricates these
				things - what it lacks is relatively light and can be brought from the
				north pole or from asteroids mined in orbit.
				Its advantageous position at the equator for launch and landing makes it
				an excellent place for a large space port handling high volumes of cargo.
				There are also several neat tricks
				one can do in a young crater to create efficient, pleasant architecture.
				The big money is going to be at
				Lalande, so it has the first boom-town.

					<h1>Peary Crater: Water Inside, Eternal Sun Outide</h1>
					<p>
						Just a few years ago it was confirmed that in the deep constant
						shadow of the craters of the Moon's poles there is water. Plus a
						mix of other substances that were steamed out of the rest of the
						Moon eons ago - carbon dioxide, ammonia. There seem to be hundreds
						of millions of tons of it, perhaps billions. There ensued excitement
						about the new possibilities for settlement this creates - within a
						small community. Most of the world has already discarded the idea of
						settling the Moon and wants to press on to Mars, if they favor
						space settlement at all. We have fogotten the images of lunar bases
						and towns that were so common during the Apollo days.
					</p>
					<p>
						That small community noted that right beside those reserves of
						volatiles (being substances that are normally too volatile in the
						lunar environment to stick around), there are peaks on the crater
						rims that receive sunlight over 90% of the time. If you can raise
						solar panels on masts 30 m or so, in the right spots they would get
						sunlight virtually all the time. So you have solved energy and water,
						two really big challenges.
						<br><br>
						Thus most pushes for lunar bases these days focus on the poles. There
						is even a business model - turn the water into liquid hydrogen and
						liquid oxygen, and sell it as feul for satellites, deep space missions,
						and space stations. Unlike putting a base on Mars, this is a space
						program we could undertake quickly, it is much safer, and it has
						practical payoffs here at home - space refeuling would allow much
						more space exploration.
						<br><br>
						It has been repeatedly debated whether the base at Peary
						Crater should be the first priority, or the first missions should go
						to Lalande and expand to Peary from there. There are several reasons
						to doubt hydro-lox fuel production would be a
						good business in this paradigm. An orbital tether system,
						ion drive cargo ships, and nuclear shuttles are all part of this plan,
						which hugely cuts down the importance of local hydrolox.
						The water needs of Lalande in the early days could be provided from
						Earth. The choice of nuclear power plants negates the need
						for constant sun.
					</p>
					<p>
						On further investigation, a version of the construction technique
						planned for Lalande would work with the minerals found in the highlands,
						where the poles are. That means a large
						habitat like proposed for Lalande could be made at Peary, allowing
						the early research and development needed for the core business in this
						paradigm - construction - to be done there. The assertion is that
						construction is the best and fastest way to make a Moon settlement
						profitable, so it is quite significant to have a way to work at the
						pole on the core business, as well as volatile mining.
						In that case, the advantage
						of the machines not needing to deal with night also weighs in favor
						of going there first. So, now the idea is that a small settlement is
						made at Peary, and then the first crew sends machines to Lalande and
						makes the next hab.
						<br><br>
						The early robotic missions would focus on making
						the hab, not on volatile mining. It is much better for people to be
						nearby when undertaking something as tricky as extracting volatiles
						from one of the coldest places in the solar system. Since the focus
						is developing construction capability, the missions can take more
						time to perfect and ramp up production of water,
						carbon dioxide, and ammonia. At first the water that is obtained is
						only to supplement the fuel supply of the nuclear shuttles. Then it
						supplies their fuel entirely, and then the new colony has more and
						more freedom to use water for greenhouses.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, Peary starts
						shipping water, carbon, and ammonia to Lalande in ever larger
						amounts. That water stays on the Moon, to make ponds, then swimming
						pools, then small lakes. Maybe some would ship to orbit for fuel,
						or radiation shielding. But
						there might be no need. By this time asteroids will be mined for
						water and metals and may be a better source for needs in open space.
