The timeline is finished, going past the tipping point that turns all of cis-lunar space into a boom town. I decided to put a figure on it of 50 years from launch of the first mission to arrival of The Boom  at the end of the Residence Program. It is about 30 pages long and has gone through several revisions. The lunar health regimen, currency, a constitution, urban plan of Lalande City, child rearing, the Moon Fleet, farming, the vertical skyhook in LEO with its 200 kiloton asteroid - it's all there.
