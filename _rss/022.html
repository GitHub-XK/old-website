The link goes to the panel discussion that included David Livingston, John Jossy, me, and Haym Benaroya (from left to right), which really struck a chord. There are lots of great presentations from SC17 on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtNwXHzshExRH3tA0v3y63w/videos">Icarus Interstellar YouTube channel</a>, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOM8JSzuFgA&t=477s">my own</a>. Other personal favorites: Miguel Alcubierre, Richard Obousy, Alan Hale, Haym Benaroya, Christoph Latz, Angelo Vermeulen.
