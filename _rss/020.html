The link goes to the new little fly-over video of Cernan's Promise on YouTube. I hope to do much better in the near future, but at least now it has better lighting and detail, and is set on the real model of Lalande. And there's more! Sigvart has quietly been making a whole set of tools that calculate or demonstrate different things - lunar gravity turns, 3d map of the nearest stars, engine lists, oh my! Some are in progress, but they are interesting so it's better to have them up. Find them under Misc Tools on the Learn page.
