We talked about the new power plant design, collaboration, the future of the project, kids in space, idealism in space, and the upcoming Starship Congress speech and panel. I enjoyed it. This was my 6th appearance on The Space Show. When i'm next on i'll have a lot more new content to talk about - it's time for an uptick there.
