We finally have a completely revised power plant, explained in detail in the annotated model at the link. It was discussed in the latest blog post. We look forward to rendering it as a CAD model too and starting to run simulations. There is also a concept for a simpler version of this that would run only during the day, and be easier to build and maintain. That's MolbOrg's project, i await details so i can model it.
