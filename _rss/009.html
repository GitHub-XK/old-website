The new section of the timeline starts looking at the Residence Program. This is an approach to funding settlement that allows nations to pay to have astronauts go to the first permanent habitats for life. By financing payment over a few years, and lowering the price while raising the accepted population of each round, the cost of building the colonies is almost completely covered by Residency income. Nations, and in late rounds possibly smaller sponsoring groups, pay to have a representative on the Moon actively engaged with them back home for several decades - inspiring, teaching, sharing discoveries and creations.
