A lot of stuff can be done with a silo that bubbles gas through molten lava. The model at the link goes over the use that has been examined, of reducing ilmenite into water, iron, and titanium dioxide. But bubbling hydrogen through other melts containing iron could be used to leave behind a mixture that is good for making clear glass. That would be mighty useful. I'm working on figuring that out right now.
