The Lalande fanpage is done, many layout issues have been fixed, the mining section has a snazzy table (in progress), the timeline page has begun. Now it is reading week for me. I shall prepare for my interview on The Space Show next Tuesday, fight the flu, and clean up the general mess after several months of long hours.
