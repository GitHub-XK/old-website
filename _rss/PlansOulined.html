Lots of big ideas have been piled onto the timeline. The Residence Program with thousands of international astronauts, the shipyard at the anchor of the equatorial tether complex, the Moon Fund to oversee finances and Moon Agency to run the colonies - it goes all over. Still not done, of course. And also it is only a skeletal framework that will be used to organize the virtual colony work. A bunch of installations are appearing that need names, suggestions appreciated.
