The dustroaster - a little thing that zaps lunar dust so hard all the molecules break into atoms that are herded to different spots - has been much improved and finally annotated so you can take a tour of it. Having done that, i see an inaccuracy that is bad enough it needs fixing, so it will change again by tomorrow i think. The metal collectors are far too small, and to fix it that whole part will need to be redesigned. So i could have waited til tomorrow to post about it, when it should be done, but see, i'm trying to get used to posting far more so you get a sense of the ongoing process. Because really, things change every day, and also my estimate of when something will be done is not that reliable. For instance, in this case i think the metal collector slots need to be turned sideways so the molten metal trickles down them into larger receptacles. That's completely not in the simple schematics that go with that patent, so Peter Schubert, the inventor, might shoot that down when i show him. But feedback dialogues have been quite rewarding so far, so - onward. :)
