<a href="https://www.moonwards.com/machinesMining.html">and Mining</a>. Website overhaul continues. New stuff in Power: PV panels, beamed power, and flywheels. New in Mining: solar furnaces, solar thermal reactor, molten regolith electrolysis, glass production, and excavation. Existing sections have also been rewritten. Next up, Transport. A rewrite was necessary to make everything integrate with the new Timeline, but it has ended up going well beyond that too.
