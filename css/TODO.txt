TODO: Use bourbon mixins where possible, they are
better organized and more complete (they have all the
webkit prefixes, for instance). What can't be
done that way, put in a _layout.scss partial -
that includes all the variables below, and mixins for the
main elements of our layout. The current _standard_mixins
partial will be converted to that.

Actually, probably it would be best to follow the
recommendations in the DevTips videos:

Incorporate rem for sizing
and get rid of px.

Incorporate media queries as part of
elements that need to be responsive but should stack below
a certain viewer width. Sass allows
media queries to be added as properties of a selector.


Make a really good page that people with incompatible
browsers are taken to, that sells the idea of upgrading,
and also explains why and has a link to a basic site
if they absolutely won't or can't.

Solve:
  Comment sections, in-house
  RSS feed generator - Jekyll looks like a good option
  Blog - Jekyll for that too
  Getting rid of Sketchfab - Three.js canvasses?
  YouTube channel - replace on the site with Vimeo?

Create reading list, codepens, and video that explains the
way the css and html works, so others can easily maintain
or add to it.

Check out Jade and see if the html should also be adapted.

Check out making Atom packages, hacking Atom, and Electron,
so we can essentially create a custom CMS for Moonwards.
