Convinient sequence probably is somehing like that:

Take look for presence of old and big stuff

#./show_big_and_old.sh

Take more preciese look at which files present in the history and not present in the current revision

#./_clean.sh ..

take look at cl.todelete.lst file which is generated
Edit _to_protect and _to_delete file lists and run the cleanup script again
take look at cl.todelete.lst file again, for the presence of unwanted stuff.

_to_protect and _to_delete files are --basic-regexp patterns for grep which does the sorting out job in the case.
there basically two entries .* for anything, or full path/name. basically bash glob syntax except of '*' needs to be '.*' and the dot have meaning of any single symbol.

after to delete list is satisfying, actual cleanup might happen.

#java -jar ./bfg-1.12.15.jar -bi ./cl.bids ..
#git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive


BFG repo cleaner here https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/

Backup is probably a necessity in all the changing process.
bfg asks to make bare copy of repository but it works without that.

Commands considered to be executed from scripts directory and assumed that bfg is present in the same directory.
