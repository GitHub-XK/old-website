      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

That was like pressing a big red button in the middle of my forehead, so i am responding here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we only think about what could be realistically done under existing political realities, we fail to see the real nature of space exploration. Decisions about undertakings of this scope should be made knowing the best and worst possible outcomes within our lifetimes. This is really important, but the matter is almost completely neglected. That's because we haven't had the tools before to really examine it. Now we do, and time is of the essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Spudis has a wonderful detailed plan for lunar exploration, in my opinion the best out there by far, very realistic and reasonable. I have to ignore it almost completely. There is a list of reasons. I will look at the main three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, you can't sell ice mining to the public. I mean, maybe they'll shrug and say 'whatever, yay Americans in space', but there will be no new enthusiasm. It's like the ISS, but with wet dirt. Not interesting if you aren't a space nerd. Paul knows this. He has astutely designed something that can be done within the existing budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, it leaves out in the cold the many key facts known only to space nerds, a constant source of frustration. Nuclear ships are safe and the technology is ready, but nobody dares use them. Development of tethers would not be that hard for use in lunar orbit, and the payoff would be massive, but it is an unexplored road and everyone wants to stick to the safe, known things because budgets are lean and government types are skittish. The Moon has gigantic military potential once you are there and settled in. Really, gigantic. There is a tipping point beyond which activity in space will suddenly explode, that point may be much closer than almost anyone realizes, and it will change the world profoundly. People need to know these things. It's important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three, the world needs a new way of being, and it needs help finding it. The world we know can't continue the way it is. We have done pretty well, for such a young species. But we are becoming very powerful very quickly and we are ill prepared to handle that kind of power. The planet has become more peaceful over the last century but is an awful long way from being peaceful enough for me to be comfortable with a slew of technologies that we already have becoming commonplace around the globe, never mind the technologies just around the corner. Moonwards may not seem relevant to a search for a new societal model, but it is. Once it is actually modeling a society on the Moon, that will become clear. That has to be done extremely well in order to work, but it can, and if it doesn't, it will show a path forward that will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bit has been very hard to convey. Living in space is the goal here, the only thing the public really cares about. And they are right. That is the thing that will change who we are. Who will we become? Will we destroy ourselves? Will we devastate our environment? Will there be a powerful elite and a mountain of poor? Will we be free? Will we be people we could respect and admire?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Space science fiction looks at this, but through a glass darkly. We need to look at it directly and really think it through as much as we can before it actually happens. I'd say we likely only have 30 years.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/3156352983384272776/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/12/kapitalist-asked-if-moonwards-could.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3156352983384272776'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3156352983384272776'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/12/kapitalist-asked-if-moonwards-could.html' title='Ice Mines Don&apos;t Sell'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-4976455686104115344</id><published>2016-12-03T14:06:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2016-12-20T13:17:46.517-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Colony Expansion</title><content type='html'>Sketching things rapidly is really helpful for discussion. In the last 3 weeks i've sketched all the main installations of the colony in order to create an overview, and a framework that can be the basis for improvement. There are still a number of undocumented things, nonetheless there is so much more in the colony models i'm having trouble deciding how to explain it. At the same time, the models are such simple sketches, they don't really get across the richness of the ideas unless the viewer fills in a fair bit... Let me see if i can paint this picture for you now with what we have...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4REko7F0S0/WEMbraRQWII/AAAAAAAAWXs/YQjlzTYVFBsNLjPNHITPZxNeQs1e4wOQwCK4B/s1600/OverviewBirdsEye.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4REko7F0S0/WEMbraRQWII/AAAAAAAAWXs/YQjlzTYVFBsNLjPNHITPZxNeQs1e4wOQwCK4B/s400/OverviewBirdsEye.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Whole Phase 1 colony looking west over the crater rim&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span id="goog_358868681"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="goog_358868682"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The developed area is 2.5 km north-south (1.5 miles), 4.4 km east-west (2.7 miles), and 1.3 km (0.8 miles) top to bottom, plus the things not in the image, which are the space port and the second solar-thermal power installation, each of which are a few kilometers further away. This is the colony known as Cernan's Promise, at the full extent of it's development. Which is to say, this is the full extent that will be modeled as a complete virtual environment. The scale of it makes it hard to show people - it's like showing photos of your vacation. This perhaps can get across this odd threshold i've crossed. To me, this is a place. I built it, i've spent hundreds of hours doing so in its virtual space. And it is still a pale shadow of the far more complex and complete version in my head, as i have not yet been able to create all that. At the moment, i am the sole citizen of Cernan's Promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--y_QGdT4iUQ/WEMjBLU9n1I/AAAAAAAAWX4/Kcz_V_oSgbErXyAGD5RG0JG12O2UVobFACK4B/s1600/OverviewStoN.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--y_QGdT4iUQ/WEMjBLU9n1I/AAAAAAAAWX4/Kcz_V_oSgbErXyAGD5RG0JG12O2UVobFACK4B/s400/OverviewStoN.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shot looks north from the south end of the colony. At bottom right is a section of the glass and basalt composite dome over the small crater i call Teacup Crater, which is 300 m across (yards are 10% more, so 330). That dome alone could be an entire blog post. I plan to do a series of such posts, for now suffice to say that real colonization is going to require domes like this, so we might as well dive in. We are modeling the beginning of a Moon civilization here folks. This is the scale that will be involved and we need to adjust to that, let it sink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shown in the bottom left is the first draft of the main version of the rover, which is a slight adaptation of the &lt;a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/systems/system.cfm?System=11"&gt;ATHLETE&lt;/a&gt; rover. It can do a lot of the coarse construction work, using a wide variety of attachments that can go on the ends of its legs - JPL designed it that way. This venture involves construction of a complete colony though, so it is going to need a supplemental arm capable of more detailed work, and smaller robots that have little mobility of their own will be delivered by it to work posts it installs, again for the purpose of performing the detailed work. People on Earth and at the polar settlement will operate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind it is the gantry crane, which is copied from the &lt;a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/097/jresv97n3p373_a1b.pdf"&gt;NIST spider crane&lt;/a&gt;. I think it will need to be switched to a square configuration, but it has great advantages as a lunar crane. The platform at its center is currently empty, but will bear a robot that can be moved anywhere within the volume below the triangular frame of the crane, down as far as the cables reach. Here it straddles the width of one of the dugout habitats, to show one way it will be used. It will do the excavation of the dugout and gallery habs. It will also be useful in assembling and erecting large structures like the hangars, mirror troughs, and radiator stations. Many of those are visible in the middle ground of the picture. In the top corner is the hangar of the space port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4vkr6DfhIY/WEMrQDYzbqI/AAAAAAAAWYI/KXsMRHie-lA1LWi1gOMwK0-qlRS58oUxACK4B/s1600/OverviewNtoSE.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V4vkr6DfhIY/WEMrQDYzbqI/AAAAAAAAWYI/KXsMRHie-lA1LWi1gOMwK0-qlRS58oUxACK4B/s400/OverviewNtoSE.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shot looks southeast from the north end of the colony. Most of the hangars are visible from this angle. This colony is an industrial center. After the initial phase of settlement, which is funded by selling permanent residence spots to nations, the economy is based mostly on in-space construction. That allows a great reduction in reliance on Earth for supplies, which is a huge cost savings, and provides income from selling services and goods to Earth that space construction makes possible. The colony builds space stations, space ships, and orbital tethers. That is why there are many very large hangars. Most are just covered spaces so that the interior is free of dust and stays within a narrow temperature range - they hold no atmosphere. The ones with the rounded ends, that don't have the reflective insulation on their roofs, contain an atmosphere about 0.1% that of Earth, so that heat dissipation can occur at the rate needed for production of basalt fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complement of melt-in-place stations fill the middle ground. Their beds get filled with tamped and leveled powder regolith, then a Fresnel lens scans the length of the bed, melting it to a depth of an inch or so. Just before the material solidifies it is cut into shapes. Those are the construction materials used to build most things shown. The construction method is explained further on the website. It is due for a lot of updating, but basically it is all there. The main papers the concept is based on are part of LPI's &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_bases/"&gt;Lunar Bases and Space Activities of the 21st Century&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- James Blacic's &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_bases/LSBchapter07.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks&amp;amp;page=53"&gt;Applications of Lunar Glass Structural Components&lt;/a&gt;, and Rowley and Neudecker's &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_bases/LSBchapter07.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks&amp;amp;page=32"&gt;In-Situ Rock Melting Applied to Lunar Base Construction&lt;/a&gt;. It's been plucked from a few other places as well - one of the many things i need to document better. What i'm trying to say is - this has all been thought through. It is only different from other lunar settlement concepts because it assumes a high level of ongoing funding. That assumption naturally leads to new and exciting vistas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vistas like this one, from inside one of the tubular habs branching off the lower gallery - the galleries are the long habs descending the slope of the crater wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DT68wNCD7cc/WEM2qRESnyI/AAAAAAAAWYY/jr8h8RrI74EYB-sR8x5olefg4rfZ2cY2gCK4B/s1600/TubeHabView.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DT68wNCD7cc/WEM2qRESnyI/AAAAAAAAWYY/jr8h8RrI74EYB-sR8x5olefg4rfZ2cY2gCK4B/s320/TubeHabView.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panaromic views like this are alright when they are of the ground. Very little particle radiation backscatters from the ground - that is what cosmic radiation is, particles, that is the long term danger. EM radiation - gamma, x-ray, alpha, and beta - can be blocked with a few inches of glass doped with a dense element like platinum. Yes, platinum. By this time asteroids are regularly arriving in orbit to be mined, platinum would be a cheaper and better metal to use for radiation-blocking glass than the lead that is used today on Earth. Bulk production of clear glass is a high priority, too. If you manage that, then you can do this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LarQBRDPV_M/WEM8d9tqAkI/AAAAAAAAWYk/OKul-ky0aLEHxBAAMcDQL7EMLtWANiQMgCK4B/s1600/LalandeDome.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LarQBRDPV_M/WEM8d9tqAkI/AAAAAAAAWYk/OKul-ky0aLEHxBAAMcDQL7EMLtWANiQMgCK4B/s320/LalandeDome.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, the image doesn't really do it justice, but that is a glass dome over all of Lalande Crater. 22 km across. The blue towers are 75 m wide. Not only do they distribute the load of holding down the dome against the strain of the atmosphere inside, they are buildings. Each one can house thousands of people. Sure, you need to develop the infrastructure to fabricate enough glass for a dome at least 5 m thick over all of this. But the payoff doesn't need to be explained, the outlay doesn't need to be justified. If we could do this, we would. Even if it meant a lot less of our disposable income went to other non-essentials like fashion, treat foods, sport events, booze and cigarettes. If we could do something like this, we'd be willing to let go of a few things like that. Like we were willing to do during World War II, but for a much healthier pay-off. That is the premise of this project. If the vision can be painted clearly enough, if the path can be explained completely enough, the will to pursue it will appear. And even if it doesn't, it will be a great vehicle for pondering where we are going, and why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't kid yourself. It is outlandish now, but the ability to do this could appear much faster than we expect. If robots that can work with little direction are developed, we'd only need to send a few and it would snowball. It is the kind of thing that can suddenly be upon you, changing the world while you are still deciding if you think it's a good idea. This is a great time to work on a vision that can ensure the future is positive.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/4976455686104115344/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/12/colony-expansion.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4976455686104115344'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4976455686104115344'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/12/colony-expansion.html' title='Colony Expansion'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4REko7F0S0/WEMbraRQWII/AAAAAAAAWXs/YQjlzTYVFBsNLjPNHITPZxNeQs1e4wOQwCK4B/s72-c/OverviewBirdsEye.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-2178644973514489727</id><published>2016-11-07T15:49:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2016-12-20T13:17:19.147-08:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Walking on the Moon</title><content type='html'>I have spent a lot of time in and around Lalande Crater on the various maps of the Moon. I have my favorite spots. I've developed an inordinate fondness for it as clearly one of the handsomest craters. I have burning questions about what is really there. So, when i decided it was time to make a 3d model of it using LRO imagery and topographical data, it isn't surprising this activity stretched to over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the modelling of craters as a pleasant pass time. If you enjoy maps and scale models, you will find it rewarding. We have a whole Moon covered with craters for which such models do not exist, so you can also enjoy the fact the result is a first and might be useful to someone. Really. There are very few such things in existence, and what there is isn't very detailed. &lt;a href="https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/search/lunar"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; (of course) has the best collection, but the size of the smallest details in their models is still on the order of 100 meters (300 feet). Also, all the listed models at the link have been stretched vertically for dramatic contrast, which makes me shudder. Cosmetic fixes like that aren't necessary if you lovingly detail a smaller feature by using photos for reference, instead of modelling areas a hundred kilometers across using only topographical data. &amp;nbsp;LRO photos have resolutions as small as 50 cm per pixel (20 inches). With them you can show off the Moon's actual rugged terrain, as it really is. But, it takes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LOLA laser altimeter on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is an exquisitely accurate instrument - attached to a probe moving at orbital speed that has no way to precisely calculate its position. Thus, the fact is LOLA topographical data is very coarse and full of artifacts. Step one is correcting those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G2fDv3xrMO0/WBkDyt8DxKI/AAAAAAAAWUE/EUe0ot6c2X4LJ2P8r_KPChDxQjTazkzXwCK4B/s1600/LalandeLOLA.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G2fDv3xrMO0/WBkDyt8DxKI/AAAAAAAAWUE/EUe0ot6c2X4LJ2P8r_KPChDxQjTazkzXwCK4B/s400/LalandeLOLA.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, there aren't actually any ruler-straight lines cutting through this crater, or any pancake-flat mesas on its rim. In fact the LOLA data was only good for establishing some base-line reference points at key spots where one could be confident the data was accurate. It is mostly useful for large scale stuff. I was grateful a friend had passed it along to me though. I undid the imaginary mountains and gullies by hand until a very rough but basically accurate shape was created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step two is to download some of the &lt;a href="http://wms.lroc.asu.edu/lroc/"&gt;wealth of LRO close-ups&lt;/a&gt; of the lunar surface and stitch together an image you will lay over the 3d model. This step can take a long time if you are fussy. The LRO has taken images of Lalande from different orbits over time, and the changes in altitude changed the perspective in the shots. There is more foreshortening in the shots taken from closer, which leads to a difference in apparent location of objects of a couple of hundred meters in many places. In movies, 'vertigo shots' use this by moving a camera on a dolly towards the subject while zooming out at the same rate. Here is an example i especially like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MWRncNMEhLw/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWRncNMEhLw?feature=player_embedded" width="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once i appreciated this, there ensued many days of painstaking warping of the shots taken from closer to mold them to the perspective in the shots taken from farther away. The seams between sections are not perfect, but they are as good as i could make them in a time frame that made any kind of sense at all. The Blender 3d program can be used exquisitely to perform this task, once one figures out how, which in my case took quite a while. If i were to give a tutorial to others on how to do it, i could convey a polished version of the process, the one i developed over many days of frustration, and then those others could quietly enjoy repeating the process on other craters while perhaps listening to an audio-book or chatting. I, instead, struggled most of the time to understand why things weren't working and trying to sort a bunch of different versions each with many layers. Now, after it's all done, i've gone back and admired the nearly perfect alignment of images on the &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/2ftCyZs"&gt;Quickmap LRO collage&lt;/a&gt; of Lalande Crater. They must have a program that takes all the LRO data associated with each image file and uses that to correct their proportions and project them onto a virtual globe. Lucky sods. There are still misalignments - my manual alignment is about as good. It took me three weeks, but if i did it again i could do a better job in maybe 3 or 4 days. If you, dear reader, undertook to build your own crater model, you might prefer to simply set up Quickmap with the image layer of the desired crater that has the least shadows, and take grid of a couple hundred screenshots of the result in the top resolution, and then patch those together. It would be about the same amount of work but at least it requires a lot less concentration, so you could enjoy a nice podcast while you work, or some such. Oh, by the way - don't attempt this unless you have a computer built for heavy graphics work. It took mine 15 minutes on many occasions to complete a command, and it is built for this kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 is to take the final image and use it to refine the rough LOLA model. This is where you will really appreciate having your highly detailed and accurate image to work from. You can paste it onto the surface of the rough 3d model and line it up in good registration with it, then sculpt straight up and down where the image indicates rises and slopes. A supplementary reference from the side is really useful here. The &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/"&gt;Apollo photographs&lt;/a&gt; from orbit are pure gold at this stage. This one a friend found for me is one of my all-time favorite pictures:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FboRLNpnG7A/WCDuKn9oj0I/AAAAAAAAWUU/1h3K37ZeNdsznVCOyMO7DoGR64WmNH67ACLcB/s1600/Apollo16-fromSouth-allLalande.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="181" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FboRLNpnG7A/WCDuKn9oj0I/AAAAAAAAWUU/1h3K37ZeNdsznVCOyMO7DoGR64WmNH67ACLcB/s320/Apollo16-fromSouth-allLalande.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now i have recreated only the main contours of Lalande. I look forward to quietly adding detail when i have time, or when i feel a need to ruminate for a while. All sorts of things are happening within it. Why do a series of domes well up across the crater floor? What about these things that look like burst bubbles as large as one of those domes - is that an indication the domes could be hollow? (Edit Dec 6: Paul Spudis thinks that is highly unlikely, and that the blister shapes found on the floors of young craters are probably caused by large chunks of ejecta protruding from the surface of the melt.) This thing looks like an old lava vent - could that be what it is? That long sinuous crease in the floor, leading away from a large secondary crater - why did that form? Could there be a lava tube underneath the surface there? There are large areas of scree on the steep upper crater slopes - will there be lots of clean chunks of bedrock in those fields? Why is the northern spur of the central mountain so covered in boulders, and in particular on its western slopes? Walking around in the 3d model stimulates speculation...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IrEiXHKrq5k/WCEJGPjIhVI/AAAAAAAAWUk/eb1A1_uK3eEosHhY4u-oCzx-KWAjHrUHQCLcB/s1600/LalandeMontage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IrEiXHKrq5k/WCEJGPjIhVI/AAAAAAAAWUk/eb1A1_uK3eEosHhY4u-oCzx-KWAjHrUHQCLcB/s320/LalandeMontage.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;So now i need to update the 3d model on the website, which right now is an old, less accurate model. The crater walls are very steep near the rim, it took me a while to get that right, and still it is only done for the patch below the site of the colony. &amp;nbsp;And then i can move on to putting in sketches of all the infrastructure planned for further out, to have a general overview of the project. Which should be much more fun. I did a short fly-through video of part of that model, there will be better ones later when i get the hang of it more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VgkwPsfmAig/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VgkwPsfmAig?feature=player_embedded" width="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;I have promised myself i will spend no more than 2 weeks completing the rough draft that will go on this 3d map i've spent a month building. I am very prone to fiddling and fussing. It is time to start spitting things out so a broader dialogue can be started about how things should be and what we should work on. But it is nice to know i can put in my little stick-figure buildings and installations on a beautiful and accurate model of Lalande crater. It just makes me feel better about the whole thing. :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;P.S.

It has gotten me thinking how little conversation there really is about the future being pursued here. There is lots of analysis of the market and the technology, but not of where we are headed. Sure, the viability of colonizing Mars is discussed, and the reasons for pursuing space settlement in general. But there is no sense of how scale affects the whole thing, and changes the whole panorama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is contemplation of key projects that would expand the launch market enough to spur other development, but each such plan has major weaknesses. Space solar power can't work unless it would be cheaper and better than covering a fraction of a few deserts in solar thermal power plants with underground heat storage, which it wouldn't be. Lunar propellant production needs a market to already exist for that much rocket fuel to make sense, and instead of that being a growing market, the existing market is switching to fuels the Moon can't provide. Space tourism seems the best bet but would likely be gutted by one fatal launch accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elon is right, the only way to cross this bridge is to take people to live on another celestial body. He has just picked the wrong one. We can argue all day about the logistics of water and fuel. Logistics is not the point. The point is The Reason To Go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elon has leaned hard on the idea we should be a multi-planet species, if only for safety reasons. Well, let us look at the possible ways people could be wiped off the face of the Earth in the time frame it would take to create an independent Mars colony. You have your asteroids and your super-volcanoes. Those are both slim chances. If we get wiped out it will be us who does the wiping. We have been waging less war recently, but if resources become scarce that will change fast. I don't think we'll kill ourselves off, but it is a great way to make the point the reason to go to space is to change Earth. It will take a large cultural change on Earth to remove the risk of devastating wars, and simultaneously free the resources needed to make all our lives much better. That can be done from space, but you have to stay close enough to home to have that impact. So, go to the Moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can all agree changing our future is what we are trying to do, right? All of us in the space community are trying to lift the collective gaze of humanity from our petty thinking to the boundless expanse of the heavens. That gaze will not stay lifted unless people can SEE something out there and feel they might be able to reach it themselves if they try. And now let's contemplate how much accessible water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen in huge quantities on Mars matters, if the goal is to get people to another world where they can live happily for the rest of their lives at a price many could afford: it doesn't matter one bit. Because it is all about the transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The irony of the owner of a rocket company failing to see this is rich indeed. Especially one who has correctly nailed reusability as the key to everything, and advanced so far towards that goal. I wonder if slapping him a few times would help...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;entire point&lt;/i&gt; of SpaceX's Mars plan is that by making the cost of transport really cheap, you can get the massive payloads needed out there within your budget. Unfortunately, you can only launch every 2 years, when Mars is in the right spot, so the advantage gained is limited. You can launch to the Moon at any time, though, and not only that, the same ship will be back in LEO in only a week to be reloaded. (Slap.) What do you care if you have to add a bunch of trips so that you can send all the water, carbon, and nitrogen the colony needs? Your launcher is reusable. The more you use it, the cheaper each trip is for you. Your whole business plan is based on that. (Slap.) In fact, you couldn't possibly use it to load Mars ships enough times to make that pay off, to leverage that benefit 95% of its payloads would need to be going someplace else - even if the launch market for Earth satellites was several times the size it is today. In fact - how are you supposed to make the money needed to create the giant fleet for your Mars city? Where is all that business supposed to come from? You know what you need in order to have that much business? A destination that is only 3 days away, at any time. You need the Moon. (Slap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, if you aren't sending people with all the food, water, and other supplies needed to live for several months in space, then you have freed up the payload you need to send enough supplies for them to live on the Moon forever. Because it will need to be a closed ecosystem, so send the food for a Mars journey instead as stuff to enrich enough lunar soil into garden soil to support one person, and you're done. (Slap.) But wait, why would you endlessly send basics from Earth when you could go catch some near-Earth asteroids, put them in lunar orbit, and get all that stuff from them? And since you have been studiously working on collapsing the cost to LEO by two orders of magnitude, the precious metals that would also be in those asteroids could be profitably returned to Earth and help finance the venture. I will forego the virtual slaps for that, and for not considering that the transport costs between LEO and the Moon can be vastly reduced again by developing a system of tethers between the two worlds, because that depends on things that aren't directly implied by the very transport system SpaceX is working on. But the ITS does imply the ability to move massive amounts of stuff around space, so if that was used to build a city on the Moon instead of Mars, it is easy to see how you could use that city and your ships to then build other things in cislunar space, such as space stations, more space ships, space-based solar power that actually makes sense, satellites. And since you made the Moon city possible, you would have a stake in that and make money off it, whereas there is no possible business model with a Mars city, other than the city itself. (Slap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a Moon city harder to build than a Mars city? No, it is easier. The first structures can be built by robots operated remotely from Earth, a technique not possible on Mars due to the signal transmission time. That also means you can get much more out of each kilogram of payload you put on the Moon before people arrive, and when they do, a big beautiful place will be there for them, not a few tin cans with dirt heaped on top. Which means those people are a lot more likely to stay, and live happily, and do great things. Great things that impact the Earth, because they will be just as connected here. They will tweet and game and make phone calls and post photos and videos and stream stuff and surf like they'd never left. On Mars? Nope. Eventually they will go back and forth regularly, and lots of people will visit. So don't talk to me about how Mars has more resources. The Moon has big-time resources where it counts - 7 billion people 3 light-seconds away, to whom the Moon is relevant, and Mars is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the easiest and best place to make a city where you could take people for a few hundred grand to live for the rest of their lives, happily, and not go broke, is the Moon. Also, you might save the Earth while you are at it. Stop it with this Mars stuff. It makes no sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: while it may seem that i get undue pleasure out of visualizing slapping Elon Musk, that isn't true.

The poster, Sam D, mentioned in another post how lava tubes help with this, and that is indeed one reason why the idea of just sealing one up and using it as a hab is popular. I haven't ever properly explained why the habs we've designed will have very stable temperatures, so, now i am. (There is a different version of this on the forum more tailored to the asker, here i'm rearranging it a bit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have enough mass within the whole gallery space, then heat regulation is easy. Just make sure that enough heat leaves over the night to balance what came in during the day. That will mostly happen through the rock of the gallery floor and lower walls. If anything, the windows won't be enough for that and very minimal radiators would need to run every now and then at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Gallery, the heat entering during the day is what comes through the light tubes, and the water dome at the bottom, which is a small fraction of the sunlight falling on the surface covering the Gallery. Each light tube would pass in about 27 kW of sunlight all day, and there are 76 in the current design. Note that this can be adjusted at any time - shift the angle of the Fresnel lens, and the amount of light coming in can be decreased to any fraction desired. But if that wasn't done - and it would be far better not to because sunlight really feels good and makes plants grow - the whole set would pass almost exactly 2000 kW of sun in all day. The &lt;a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d_154.html"&gt;heat capacity of most rocks found on the Moon&lt;/a&gt; is 0.8 kJ/kgK, meaning that if that sun was all hitting 2.5 tons of it, it would heat up by one degree celsius every second. Alright, that does sound like a lot, and is the exact reason sun is going to be used to make the materials for the habs in the first place. But the Gallery is going to have a HUGE amount of thermal mass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image below is from &lt;a href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/library/wilcox_2005.pdf"&gt;Constraints on the depth and variability of the lunar regolith by Wilcox et al&lt;/a&gt;, and shows the estimated depth below which the Moon is pure rock. Because of our lack of data, this model could be off quite a bit, and also in the case of large craters like Lalande, the regolith at the very rim has been &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/exploration/education/hsResearch/crateringLab/lab/part1/background/"&gt;modeled as being twice as deep&lt;/a&gt; as it is in the surrounding landscape. Still, considering how far down the crater wall the Gallery extends, it stands to reason that a large portion will be cut out of solid rock (and that isn't a problem). So how much thermal mass does it have? Well, for all intents and purposes, it is a cave. Oodles.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N0MlpGpsvHc/V_GkpdPdXmI/AAAAAAAAWRU/e3hGwYfJrH0CpiVmOZSRYHaxbNIswEbVQCLcB/s1600/bedrock-depth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="169" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N0MlpGpsvHc/V_GkpdPdXmI/AAAAAAAAWRU/e3hGwYfJrH0CpiVmOZSRYHaxbNIswEbVQCLcB/s320/bedrock-depth.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In fact it will take time to add enough heat to the structure to raise the thermal mass that affects the interior temperature enough to reach room temperature, and extra sunlight will need to be piped in for that exact purpose. (Using lava during the building process helps here.) The temperature below the surface of the Moon is about -20 degrees Celsius, so heat will be sucked up by the surrounding rock in giant quantities thanks to that gradient. No problemo. What needs to be done is to pour in enough heat that it sufficiently saturates the volume of rock that will interact with the gallery. There is a distance from the gallery walls at which the heat coming in during the two weeks of sunlight equals the heat seeping away through the rock over a lunar month. Fill the volume of rock closer than that with enough heat to keep the gallery at room temperature, and it will stay at that temperature, cooling only very slowly over the night, but heating up again an equal amount the next day. If heat stops entering it would cool only very slowly, it would be months before the residents were at risk. And why would heat stop entering? There is no weather on the Moon, as long as the lenses over the light tubes turn during the day like they are supposed to, the only variable in the strength of the sunlight is the sun - so we are talking about a difference of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#Variation"&gt;about 0.1% between solar maximum and solar minimum&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing here is that it might take so much heat to get the gallery to the proper temperature in the first place that it takes a long time to pour it all in there. If so, a simple trench cut in the rock can be used to tailor the amount of rock involved. Any void is going to be a vacuum, which is great insulation, even if it is only a centimeter wide. Line it with aluminum foil and that makes it even better. So you can limit the area through which heat is seeping away by almost any amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a book that uses this concept for the design of houses that use no heating, but remain quite close to the same temperature all the time by balancing the sun that comes in the windows with the heat that seeps out of a mass of earth kept dry and insulated from surface temperature changes under a layer of insulation and plastic. It is called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passive-Annual-Heat-Storage-Improving/dp/0615905889"&gt;Passive Annual Heat Storage&lt;/a&gt;, by John Hait. The concept never really took off as there aren't many people with enough space, the inclination and money to have one built, and in spots where it isn't too hard to gather enough bone-dry earth, and keep it that dry until it has been properly emplaced and protected. However, in the examples that exist, temperatures fluctuate only by 1 degree Celsius or so through the whole year, even in places with harsh winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PdaJWrMgzFI/V_KgYkRvBII/AAAAAAAAWRo/zzqy8p1Ui6AX_M_pPiqJc8_QRgG2h4AawCK4B/s1600/ae9a8f100ee19e9785bac28107c1007f.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="207" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PdaJWrMgzFI/V_KgYkRvBII/AAAAAAAAWRo/zzqy8p1Ui6AX_M_pPiqJc8_QRgG2h4AawCK4B/s320/ae9a8f100ee19e9785bac28107c1007f.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A dry earth mass extending 6 m from the house was necessary, and south-facing windows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Heat moves towards cooler spots, but it moves ever more slowly the less the difference in temperature is - the less the heat gradient is. When there is a large heat gradient and a cycle of heating and cooling, like over a day on the Moon or over a year on the Earth, places underground that are far enough away from the where the heat is changing basically never change temperature. Between that point, and where the temperature is cycling up and down, how much the ground changes temperature over that cycle smoothly increases. On the Moon, the temperature difference between the ground and the habitats would be about 41 C or so, much greater than that difference on Earth, and heat would flow through the bedrock much more quickly than it does through dry soil on Earth. The distance to where heat fluctuation ceases would thus be much further, which is why creating narrow trenched to limit the volume involved would likely be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I6B3qXM0qVU/V_K4L86wXGI/AAAAAAAAWR4/Ia0nK1gTvAQWSDOoqIpmG0A60B5Mt1L8QCK4B/s1600/heat-flow-diagram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="171" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I6B3qXM0qVU/V_K4L86wXGI/AAAAAAAAWR4/Ia0nK1gTvAQWSDOoqIpmG0A60B5Mt1L8QCK4B/s320/heat-flow-diagram.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Heat moves most where the gradient is highest&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In the drawing, the pink is the powder regolith, through which heat moves very slowly so it basically functions as a layer of insulation. The grey is the bedrock layer, the red is the stored heat that keeps the hab's temperature steady. Because the big temperature difference is always going to be between the lunar surface and the interior of the hab, heat will always move mostly either into or out of the hab through its openings - windows, light tubes, the occasional airlock, and a few small radiators. So the heat in the ground at night will move mostly towards the interior of the hab, as heat leaves through these openings. It will also seep away through the stone, but more slowly because it takes so long for changes within the hab to significantly increase the heat gradient around the edges of the volume containing all the heat. The surface area involved is much greater, though, so again, we come to the matter of creating trenches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CCI8QtTUZKU/V_LW3lAYLFI/AAAAAAAAWSk/XEVuLkWVC1codjUMNWUr8_l4OUuLCk5UACK4B/s1600/heat-flow-trenches.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="172" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CCI8QtTUZKU/V_LW3lAYLFI/AAAAAAAAWSk/XEVuLkWVC1codjUMNWUr8_l4OUuLCk5UACK4B/s320/heat-flow-trenches.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many possible options for layout of the trenches, this is just one. Mostly what the trenches do is create bottlenecks to outflow of heat so more of it stays closer to the hab. At the scale of the gallery, the vertical trenches are about 35 m long, the horizontal ones 10 m, and the diagonal ones about 15 m, since the gallery is about 32 m wide (and varies in depth). So, creating them isn't a small thing, but fiber-optic cables coming from sets of concentrating mirrors will provide a &lt;a href="http://www.psicorp.com/pdf/library/VG09-193.pdf"&gt;great tool for the job&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that can melt rock very quickly.&amp;nbsp;Since the gallery is on a slope, the molten rock created can be drained away simply by allowing it to flow away downhill. Do this correctly once, and down the centuries this space will never need more than very minimal heating or cooling, so it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light entering the sports hab is indirect light reflected off the ground outside for the first 11.5 Earth days of each Moon day. The surface of the Moon reflects very little sunlight. In Lalande, which is brighter than surrounding land, it probably reflects &lt;a href="https://the-moon.wikispaces.com/Brightness+of+Selected+Features"&gt;about 15%&lt;/a&gt; of the sun's light. How much heat would pass through the windows at different times of day is a complex calculation far beyond me, but think of it this way - it would be less than the heat passing through such windows on Earth due to indirect sunlight bouncing off lawns and fields.  For 2.5 Earth days before sunset progressively more of the windows would be hit by direct sun, mostly at an oblique angle, so that over the course of that time maybe a quarter of that sun would pass into the hab.  Water is about the &lt;a href="http://water.usgs.gov/edu/heat-capacity.html"&gt;best thermal mass&lt;/a&gt; there is, so 3000 tons of it in the pool will heat up very little due to that amount of sun over the day. It would take about 12.5 billion watts to heat it up by 1 degree Celsius. Taking everything together, i'd guess it might heat up by 3 degrees Celsius in a day. Heat is shed only by radiation in a vacuum, so only a portion of that heat would leave that space over the night. I couldn't tell you how much, that is too sophisticated a calculation for me to even estimate. But it is safe to say that after maybe 3 months, if the extra heat wasn't passed into the Gallery or shed by a small radiator over the course of the night, that space would feel too warm. Not sweltering, just too warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of the dome, for the sake of making life easy, it would be good to put a layer of that &lt;a href="http://www.glass-apps.com/products/smart-glass-windows/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw4MK_BRC1n6KTtezikbIBEiQA872hYZZFssiXaNm3GaH3bypXharQ4xWqx1EoYUcn4rmSeLEaAg3z8P8HAQ"&gt;smart glass&lt;/a&gt; on the outside, that changes opacity when a charge is run through it. The sun is pretty bright during the day so that would make it much more pleasant to be inside, aside from making it simple to fine-tune the interior temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, there will be no problem regulating the temperature of the habs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: &lt;a href="http://moonwards1.blogspot.mx/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-2.html"&gt;Health Tips on the Moon - Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the Sports Hab, and the Sketchfab on the main page labelled&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.moonwards.com/index.html#colony"&gt;Gallery Lunar Habitat&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the Gallery and the dome at the bottom of it - it is the 4th one, you have to scroll down a bit.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/4413656618449089658/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/10/nice-even-temperatures-through-magic-of.html#comment-form' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4413656618449089658'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4413656618449089658'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/10/nice-even-temperatures-through-magic-of.html' title='Nice Even Temperatures Through the Magic of Thermal Mass'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N0MlpGpsvHc/V_GkpdPdXmI/AAAAAAAAWRU/e3hGwYfJrH0CpiVmOZSRYHaxbNIswEbVQCLcB/s72-c/bedrock-depth.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-2850457750373808326</id><published>2016-09-21T10:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T07:25:52.655-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Pyramid Paradigm</title><content type='html'>Long, long ago, all of the very first nations on the face of the Earth made really big things. They made the very biggest things they could figure out how to. For a long time they raised &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith"&gt;huge stones&lt;/a&gt; over tombs or temples. Then they took to building a wide variety of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_pyramid"&gt;pyramids&lt;/a&gt;. The one we simply know as the Great Pyramid remains the heaviest structure ever built, handily beating the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_the_Parliament"&gt;Romanian Palace of the Parliament&lt;/a&gt;, which is the heaviest modern building and an interesting point of comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Romanian Parliament, known in Romania as &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060219232635/http://www.fantasypieces.org/files/Research/CasaPoporului.pdf"&gt;Casa Poporului&lt;/a&gt; (the People's House) was built by the nation's soldiers, in a land at the time ruled by a brutal dictator. It took between 20,000 and 100,000 of them working under forced labor sometimes around the clock for 5 years, and the rest of Romania was deprived of basic needs in order to fund this. It is said that hundreds of workers, maybe as many as 3000, died during construction. The project stopped when the dictator and his wife were overthrown and executed in 1989. I remember the film shown on the news in Canada of the Ceausescus' dead bodies, a clip taken by the Romanian revolutionaries who wished to prove to their countrymen that they were really dead. Despite their hatred of everything the building represents, Romanians eventually decided that it only made sense to use Casa Poporului as the seat of government, the purpose for which it was built. So much was sacrificed to build it, and it is, in the end, well adapted to the task if one looks past its authoritarian feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great Egyptian pyramids were not built under duress. Though this was believed for a long time, in reality unskilled workers labored as their customary duty to the king. They came to Giza for a season to satisfy this custom and received pay in loaves and beer. They may have been mostly volunteers. The many skilled workers who labored year-round lived well and had high social status. &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/egyptians/pyramid_builders_01.shtml"&gt;Egypt's pyramids genuinely were&lt;/a&gt; what Casa Poporului aped so tragically - national projects that forged a national identity. To this day most people recognize pictures of the Great pyramid and many travel from across the globe to see it. It isn't hard to imagine how proud the ancient Egyptians were of it, and how gladly they identified themselves with the culture responsible for it, and thus shed most of their loyalty to their tribes. And that was essential for the nation of Egypt to work. It minimized rivalry between the many small bands that existed along the Nile before they were unified, until people stopped saying they belonged to a certain tribe, and instead started saying they came from a certain village, in Egypt. Having a custom under which people from all the tribes came together to labor together on monumental religious projects was, therefore, the way the bonds were forged that made Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When one looks at all the many other giant constructions before the great pyramids of Egypt, and for some time after them, all over the world wherever nations were first forming, they were all religious. Many of them were tombs, but since ancient peoples universally believed in ghosts, essentially they were religious. That allowed tribal rivalries and conflicts to be set aside during labor to create them. Humans naturally regard spiritual matters as more important than that - even if in many cases it is only out of hope to be granted holy favor, or to avoid supernatural curses. At any rate if an attempt had been made to unify the same groups by getting them to build something together that served a political purpose, that would have provoked instant rebellion. The matter was neatly side-stepped by building temples and tombs for great spirits instead. And that led to a rather magical change in attitude - service to the holy would not be worthy unless it was fitting of the great power of the world's unseen forces. It was therefore critical that the monuments be things of wonder. They strived to their utmost to achieve this. This instinct was, in the end, exquisitely astute. For one, that meant it was necessary to figure out how to make detailed plans, communicate them, and then coordinate hundreds, and later thousands, of people in a very precise and highly orderly fashion. That ability was later used to build other highly complex things that were more immediately useful. What is more, their monumental efforts created the monuments that forged the identities of all the world's very first nations, which reduced the number of borders being fought over by a couple of orders of magnitude. This is known as the Neolithic Revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resources used to build those megaliths and pyramids were a much larger portion of those original nations' economies than any project in the modern world, with a very few exceptions. All of the exceptions have tones similar to that of Casa Poporului. For instance, the Palace of Versailles was possible at the peak of French power, helped by the income of its colonies, but also played an important part in the bankruptcy of the monarchy and the Revolution that followed. People have come to be very suspicious of grandiose projects. For instance, we invented the word 'grandiose'. We recognize them as a play for power on the part of an elite. They have lost all echoes of spirituality, now that there is nothing wondrous about building huge ornate things. Spiritual buildings are still often made on a larger-than-life scale, but that only goes so far. Any farther, and it becomes evident they are not there to render service &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; a community, but instead are there to demand service &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; a community. That just doesn't work any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet we are in a time of turbulent change. Once again the social systems that served us in the past seem worn out. Millennia ago when we'd covered the globe and become too sophisticated to continue fighting as one tribe against another, we created something new that gave us a new way to relate to each other. Our spirits rose to the occasion and thus we averted a future where burgeoning populations and advancing technologies caused us to soak the world in blood, as we fought tribe on tribe for ever scarcer resources. Instead we created nations, which enabled us to increase our resources so there was enough for all. Peace over large areas allowed the planting of crops over large areas, the storage of surplus in central grain silos, the processing into flour at central mills, the development of extensive irrigation systems. Soon we were off and running, specializing our labor ever more, trading over ever greater distances, figuring out how to keep track of all this commerce with symbolic marks. Sure, we also got organized slavery, standing armies, social classes, but it was still a lot better than what would have happened otherwise. The change we are in the midst of is no less significant. Once again we are in peril if we don't reorganize on a fundamental level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are striking parallels here to the Neolithic Revolution. Once again we are at risk principally because of how much more powerful we have become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again war has ceased to be a sensible way to settle disputes, because there can be no real winners. Before the Neolithic Revolution thousands of ongoing disputes between tribes all over the planet were constantly draining us and solving nothing. Now the risk is that just one war can scar the whole planet if nuclear weapons become involved. Or smaller wars can be so destructive they destabilize whole regions for decades and cause ripple effects very far away. It has gotten to the point where there are wars conducted not by nations, but by multi-national groups scattered across a dozen countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again it has come to this because of our increasing wealth and technological sophistication. We have never been so wealthy, but our numbers and our wealth have strained ecosystems all over the planet and changed the climate. Our technology is changing balances of power in every organizational category we have - institutions, industries, cultures, economies, the whole world. Traditional forms are being undermined, new ones are emerging chaotically, and the void is sometimes being replaced by something dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, the principal thing that prevents us from solving these problems is that we are splintered into groups that are too small. It took a series of wars of conquest to initiate the Neolithic Revolution. Well, on the time scales we are working with here we have already gone through two wars of unprecedented scope and cost in the recent past, the World Wars. The second one, especially, provoked an attempt to organize ourselves on an international level to avoid such conflicts in future and start solving the problems that affect the whole world. This was very valuable, but clearly has not gone nearly far enough. And it isn't a matter of putting more resources into the UN, or changing laws. We need something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, we will not find that new thing until we forge the bonds necessary for it to emerge, by working together on something so grand it brings out the best in us and instills a sense of wonder. Once again, we must transfer our loyalty to something larger and we will not unless it meets that standard, and that is fitting. Once again, it has to be something we can &lt;b&gt;see&lt;/b&gt;, something we can contemplate, a symbol around which everything else coalesces. We are still the people we were back then, when we demoted our loyalty to our tribe in favor of something larger. This is how we work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one possibility. It stares us in the face and we fear to make the commitment because it will be so hard, demand a level of commitment and coordination we have never managed before. Our ancestors surely felt the same way, but eventually it was clear there was no choice. They put their shoulders into it, and grew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have to settle the Moon. Mars is too far away to have the effect back home that is needed. A space station can't be built on the scale required without going to the Moon first. We have to go, and we have to go big. Only a project that is on the scale only possible if a large group of nations does it together will serve the purpose. It will only instill wonder at that scale. It will only forge bonds on that scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not even slightly joking about this. I believe this is of critical importance, and that we may not have much time before other events lead us into another conflict of extraordinary cost. We have managed to reorganize in some ways that will help, but it isn't enough. I believe the wonder people feel about space missions, and the inordinate eagerness of a small number of us to create these great works, is a sign of this instinct coming into play. In that case the instinct is only going to grow until it reaches the right critical mass. Will that happen before it is too late? The world has been surprisingly peaceful and ever wealthier for a long time now, it is easy to think there is no hurry here. On the other hand, nukes are being acquired by ever more unstable people, we have no idea what the near future of our climate is, and we have been performing a series of giant macro-economic experiments that show many signs of possible failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to make a broad call that touches the imagination of ordinary people and convinces them a big international Moon project would be exciting and transformational. If something awful happens and that idea hasn't already gotten purchase and begun to roll, that same instinct to take group action will move people to choose the dark twin of great construction projects: War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please help Moonwards create an exciting and realistic vision for a Moon colony. We need a strong team. There is much to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/2850457750373808326/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-pyramid-paradigm.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2850457750373808326'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2850457750373808326'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-pyramid-paradigm.html' title='The Pyramid Paradigm'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-4782728319088672584</id><published>2016-09-05T15:13:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T07:26:08.522-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>All the Reasons Why</title><content type='html'>Moonwards is a bit of a different approach to promoting space. It seems time to properly summarize that. I'm on The Space Show next Sunday, Sept. 11th, and i need to organize my thoughts. It hasn't seemed useful (up to now) to contrast it with various other projects out there, so this gap keeps reappearing where people wonder why it isn't done like x or y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;99% of the imagery of space that most people see is in fiction, there is a huge quantity of material. For most people, what we are really doing in space is pretty boring by comparison. Unless they have a background in the sciences that allows them to appreciate it, it just isn't going to hold their attention. However, the growing proportion of popular fiction that takes place in space is a signal of something important. Human cultures are increasingly transferring their broadest vision of our hopes and dreams to a space setting. If you want to reach people, and get them thinking about what the road to our greatest dreams needs to be, tapping that has huge potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Moonwards is building a bridge between the vast energy placed in fictional visions and something that could actually be done. It seeks a keen balance between realism and fantasy that powerfully makes key points about who we are and what we should pursue. A city on the Moon can capture the imagination. Yes, you could fly by flapping wings, needing only your own strength. Yes, you could leap from the water like a dolphin. You could carry 10 people on your shoulders, jump to the roof of a house. You could run for miles and miles without exhaustion - you could just run wherever you go without it being a big deal. You could run everyplace with a friend on your shoulders, and switch occasionally between who is carrying who. The scale of what we could build there once we built up infrastructure would also be that much grander. Ladders into space, skyscrapers miles high, pits miles deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you paint a picture like that, and say that isn't a fantasy, that is what it would really be like, that makes an impression. I could go on at great length on how that impression can have a ripple effect on how people see the value of things in general, and their willingness to work together to achieve the great things that can only be achieved together. But there are other things to cover...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several plans out there about businesses or colonies at a lunar pole, and yet Cernan's Promise is placed at the equator. The main defense for this is the building approach. Basalt is needed in order to build big quickly. Only with basalt can you make everything needed - the cables that contain the pressure of atmosphere, and the many different construction materials for arches, columns, floors, walls, and furnishings. Only by building large can you have long-term residents who don't go crazy but are actually happy. Selling residence is the core business of the colony in the initial phase, augmented by broadcasting that can also only be done successfully in a large, beautiful building. If you try to build large and beautiful with any other technique, it takes so much machinery to do that you might as well have used that mass to bring up the machinery to melt and process basalt. The machinery needed to create waterless concrete and build with it would weigh much more (and need rebar), the machinery to excavate and emplace regolith over inflatables would weigh about the same as the machinery needed to excavate and build with fused basalt and basalt cable. If you want something larger than an inflatable that can be rolled up and packed within a fairing, you also need equipment to stitch and weld seams that are reliably strong, and to maneuver large pieces of fabric without damaging them. Unless you reinforce the inflatable with elements strong enough to support the regolith overlay in the event of loss of atmosphere, you risk complete disaster if something rips the fabric - a fire, an explosion, a chemical spill, one person who completely loses it for 30 seconds. But if you put in that reinforcing structure, you might as well just have built out of basalt, in which case you could have built all your furnishings and internal structures in the bargain with the same machinery, and also more entire habitats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is at the equator, Cernan's Promise can't take advantage of the water and other chemicals frozen in the ground of the poles. We don't know how difficult it will be to mine the poles for water. It might be easy, but it might be very hard. I really doubt there will be a viable market for water as rocket fuel, so the money that would be spent setting up mining is better spent sending a payload of water to the equator, and methane to power a nuclear thermal shuttle. Because Moonwards looks purely at the potential of our technology, planning for nuclear ships is a logical step. That means fuel supplies can be stretched much further, especially once you add a cargo ship running on ion engines shuttling between lunar orbit and LEO. The nuclear shuttle just needs to go to orbit to unload the cargo ship. By the time the colony needs more water than can be accommodated in the payload budget it has with Earth, it will be capable of building most of the mass of the machinery and habs needed for water mining itself. Those can then be taken to the north pole for much less fuel than if everything had to be brought from Earth, and fewer Earth launches would be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More about the transport solution is in the previous post. That post is also going to be updated in a few days with input from Sigvart Brendberg, who made some very salient points recently that really improve it. Like pointing out the nuclear shuttles should run on methane, and the cargo ship should be launched as the second mission, instead of a nuclear shuttle going all the way to LEO. I'd like to highlight again the importance of tethers. Tethers in lunar orbit makes movement of bulk cargo around the moon feasible, and also movement between the surface and lunar orbit. That is critical if the Moon is to become mostly free of shipments from Earth. If you can't get all the volatiles you need from the poles, you can get them by bringing carbonaceous asteroids to orbit. With just one polar tether you can get transport coverage of most of the Moon, so once you find the craters where meteors impacted with speeds low enough that remnants of them remain there, you can find metals, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen chemicals there, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By accepting nuclear power into our lives, Moonwards also solves the energy problem of the long cold nights, which polar colonies handle by staying on peaks where there is sun 90% of the time. Nuclear generators will power the colony in the early days. Since everything is being made of solid basalt, and there are also a lot of boulders around at the site of Cernan's Promise, thermal mass will make temperature regulation way easier. Machinery outside will be protected from the cold on solid basalt platforms warmed by the sun during the day, tucked under reflective tarps that trap the heat. Later a hangar with a thick basalt floor and several layers of reflective insulation suspended tent-style over the whole space will keep temperatures quite even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think those are the things i wanted to cover... One last thing is that the influence a true colony would have on Earth, a colony with at least a thousand people, that is developing its own culture, is hard to overstate. Transmissions between the Moon and Earth would be literally a million times what that transmission power could send between Earth and Mars when they are farthest apart. Running a hundred 4K channels all the time would be no problem, with all the video calls and file transfers you could possibly want on top of that. Places that are entirely new encourage new ways of thought, and that tends to be very powerful. An example i think is relevant: American Revolution, 1776... French Revolution, 1789.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/4782728319088672584/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html#comment-form' title='10 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4782728319088672584'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4782728319088672584'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html' title='All the Reasons Why'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>10</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-7453129860237751063</id><published>2016-08-25T15:29:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T07:26:49.564-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Transportation that Builds Momentum</title><content type='html'>There is no way around it. The different resources of the Moon are in different places, and they don't seem to be close together. Mapping of resources is really patchy, low-resolution, and incomplete, so maybe there is a sweet spot that helps with this we have only to discover. Probably not, though, and even if there is, if you are talking about serious development, you are going to need to go get things from far away sooner or later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building first at the equator simplifies some things but runs into this as soon as the water supply comes up. For all that it is much easier to build big quickly at Lalande Crater, it has advantages in trajectories to and from Earth, and has much more iron, potassium, phosphorus, thorium, and rare earth elements than the poles, all of its water has to be delivered. A base at the poles could get its water from permanently shadowed craters once the machinery to do so had been developed and built. That could prove difficult and expensive though - we don't know yet. &amp;nbsp;If you set up an efficient supply route from Earth, supplying enough water doesn't get problematic until it is time to expand the colony from the initial crew of 30 to a population of hundreds. Even then, if you skipped putting in &lt;a href="http://moonwards1.blogspot.mx/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-2.html"&gt;giant swimming pools&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it is conceivable you could simply add a few cargo runs &amp;nbsp;to your schedule loaded with nothing but water from Earth and stay within your budget. However, a place on the Moon where people are supposed to live for the rest of their lives really ought to have giant swimming pools. So, the trick is how to bring kilotons of water to the colony for those residents. And just aside from that you will want to be able to move kilotons onto and off of the Moon anyhow, so this is really just the first, most obvious case of that need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, in assessing the position that follows it is important to remember that Moonwards is about showing what could be done if limitations imposed by politics were removed and serious ongoing investment was made. Actually, i should write that up as a blurb that goes in the header or sidebar of this blog... So if you see that now in that spot, this is when that occurred to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our planned route to industrial-scale cargo movement around the Moon and between it and space is first, building a shuttle with nuclear thermal engines and a cargo ship with ion engines. The shuttle would handle transport between lunar orbit and the colony, and the cargo ship would do the run between lunar orbit and low Earth orbit. Then once the initial complement of scouting and construction robots and equipment had been delivered, the next mission would set up a non-rotating tether in an equatorial orbit at an altitude of 5000 km. At first that tether, or skyhook, would only descend part way to the surface. As the shuttle and further cargo missions added mass to the tether anchor and the system was perfected, the skyhook would reach to 20 km above the surface. Finally, a polar skyhook is added and further tethers reaching to low Earth orbit. Let's look at this piece by piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuclear thermal engines would require little development to create working models, their performance is superior, they are robust and can be restarted with ease, and they are safe. Their nuclear fuel elements would not be put together and start generating high radiation until in lunar orbit, so if there was a launch accident dispersion of radiation would not happen. Once operational, shielding the engines enough to block their radiation from entering the interior of the shuttle is quite easy. The shuttle would run both on straight hydrogen, and on methane. On methane it could get a specific impulse of about 500 s, on hydrogen, about 900. Using methane would give superior thrust during take-off and landing. More importantly, shipping and storing methane is far easier than doing that with hydrogen. Possibly the total payload to the colony would be maximized by not using hydrogen at all. Or maybe if hydrogen was a small portion of the mass of the propellant, and large tanks could be used that allow use of high-pressure gaseous hydrogen instead of liquid hydrogen, it would be advantageous to use a mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The much larger cargo vessel could run on xenon. If the HiPEP ion engines NASA has worked on were fully developed, they could have a specific impulse of up to 9000 s. At that efficiency, and given that they have to use the slow spiral trajectory of low-thrust engines, they could deliver a ton of payload for every 115 kg of propellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skyhooks take more technological development. Zylon is an existing material that is strong enough for the cables, but issues to do with maintenance on a cable of that length, and how best to make cars that travel up and down it come up. The cable can't get twisted too much, it needs to be able to take hits by micrometeorites (a big hit isn't too likely, i don't think, but it has to be engineered for), and it needs to be repairable. A loose tubular braid of a couple of dozen smaller cables sounds like a good idea. Maybe the climbing car could have sort of twin caterpillar tracks that press together from either side of the cable, meshing with it at many points to distribute the strain, something like that. At any rate, these seem like moderate hurdles to overcome, especially considering how awesome the thing you get in return is. It might take some time to get used to handling the undulations and oscillations of such a cable, but those are probably minor issues that maybe need to be compensated for a bit. I leave this for now to minds that are actually trained to study such questions. I'd just like to explain how very cool it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a mass in orbit around the Moon and a tether hanging down from it toward the surface, the rate the foot of the tether moves relative to the surface is determined by the orbital period of the center of mass of the whole structure. When that point is at 5000 km altitude, and the foot is at 20 km altitude, that rate is 223 m/s. In that situation, our nuclear shuttle from the surface could go meet the foot of that tether, be grappled by it, trade a payload pod on its cargo bed for one released by the foot, hang on until the orbit is back over the colony, let go, and land on a runway. The delta V it would need to do that would be a fraction of what it would need to ascend 5000 km to meet the cargo ship in orbit. (I don't know what fraction is plausible for that - i briefly took a stab at calculating it, but my math skills aren't there yet, so i have demurred for now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tether anchor needs to have ion engines on it, enough to compensate for the downward drag of having the shuttle hanging on its foot, and the solar panels to power them. Unless the skyhook's anchor is many times the mass of the shuttles and payloads, the downward drag during loading at the foot would need to be compensated for quickly in order to avoid the foot dropping down so much that it smacks into the ground. At first the tether would need to stay much further from the surface in order to avoid this being an issue, and the shuttles would need to climb higher and faster to meet it. And so, each time they do, they might as well haul up a full load of rocks that can be taken by the climber back up to the anchor, where they would simply add to its mass. As the anchor gets heavier, the tether can be extended to reach closer to the surface. Once those rocks reach the anchor and the shuttle has let go, the center of mass rises to its usual spot, so the structure only loses the momentum needed to carry the shuttle while the exchange is being made. But since that takes a few days, between the payload from orbit descending 5000 km, the tradeoff being done, and the rocks ascending 5000 km, the upward rebound at the end of the process isn't relevant. Still, the amount of fuel used to do these maneuvers is reduced because the ion engines on the anchor do most of the work, and they are much more efficient than even nuclear thermal engines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system really takes off once a near-Earth asteroid is delivered to lunar orbit and integrated into the skyhook anchor mass. It really needs to be big though. I'm thinking the thing to model for the virtual colony would be one of about 5,000 metric tons, which is 10 times the size of what the &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/sbag/documents/Final%20Report%20Asteroid%20Retrieval%20Study%20EXTERNAL%20RELEASE%20version%2020120412a_docx.pdf"&gt;Keck Report&lt;/a&gt; on asteroid retrieval was proposing. That isn't unreasonable if you have a heavy lift launcher and the next generation of ion engines at your disposal. The asteroid would arrive already equipped with ion engines and solar panels, thanks to the equipment installed to move it. A nice carbonaceous chondrite asteroid could be counted on to bear 500 tons of water bound up in its minerals. The processing facility to extract that could be installed on the asteroid surface, and it would send that down to the colony in exchange for loads of building materials. By the time that asteroid is in place, the colony would be producing those. In fact, those building materials would be used to create a space station on the asteroid. By that time, the colony would be capable of producing most of the things needed for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A polar skyhook would also be set up and get a near-Earth asteroid of its own. With that in place, a base at one of the poles can be done in style. The machinery and gear would be delivered from Cernan's Promise by shuttles that ride the tether, and a lot of it would have been fabricated there.  So now you are talking about 1000 tons of water from the two asteroids, and a new stream of water from operations at the pole. It is going to take a while before the giant swimming pool is completely full. Once it is though, you can build another in a small fraction of the time, for a small fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With reusable launchers, this architecture is definitely something a group of nations could move forward on quickly. Having a truly reusable launcher that greatly lowers the cost of the last and most difficult link in the chain, Earth to low Earth orbit, would be the key to ramping this transport system up into a genuine cargo system. Tethers between LEO and lunar orbit would amplify the capacity of the cargo run a great deal as well. The&lt;a href="http://hopsblog-hop.blogspot.mx/2016/08/tran-cislunar-railroad.html"&gt; Trans Cislunar Railroad&lt;/a&gt; described in Hop David's blog would be the thing to add. If some of the mass being pumped up the tethers on the Moon were directed onwards to those tethers, it could be used to build very nice space stations at the anchor masses of each of them. That system would greatly reduce the transit time for cargo between the two worlds. I was greatly helped in creating this sketch of the skyhook system that will be built in Moonwards by Hop's posts on tethers..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that would be a real boon to this system being built quickly and having lots of muscle would be successful development of the &lt;a href="http://neumannspace.com/"&gt;Neumann drive&lt;/a&gt;, which the colony could then fuel with magnesium refined on the surface and sent up to the tether anchors and the cargo ships. One of the set of calculations i look forward to doing is of how having lots of magnesium-burning Neumann drives on the cargo ships and tether anchors would speed up the whole process. However it is still not clear that there won't be development problems with that drive, promising though it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transport is the secret to everything in space. Feeling comfortable that this is an efficient, effective, realistic architecture is critical to making the virtual lunar colony feel real. We think it is. Let us know what you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: This post was edited a month after the original posting in order to reflect improvements Sigvart made.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/7453129860237751063/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/transportation-that-builds-momentum.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/7453129860237751063'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/7453129860237751063'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/transportation-that-builds-momentum.html' title='Transportation that Builds Momentum'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-2632294516377304025</id><published>2016-08-17T18:42:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T07:28:31.994-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Health Tips on the Moon - Part 3</title><content type='html'>It is time to speak of radiation on the Moon. First i am going to explain it a bit, and point out things a lot of people don't know. One, we can only make decent guesses how much radiation there is on the Moon. Two, we don't know what it will do to people. Three, a bit of shielding makes it much worse, not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One - We have no direct measurements of radiation levels on the Moon's surface, and modeling that environment with software is extraordinarily complex.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063312002085"&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; based on modelling found galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) fluctuates between 0.38 Sv/yr at solar minimum and 0.11 Sv/yr during solar maximum. (The solar wind scatters GCR particles that enter the solar system, and when it is stronger less penetrate to the inner solar system.) The &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/107093/how-much-radiation-would-you-get-during-a-mars-mission/#"&gt;Curiosity rover measured &lt;/a&gt;0.66 Sv/yr in deep space on its way to Mars,&amp;nbsp;0.23 Sv/yr on the Martian surface in 2013,&amp;nbsp;when solar activity was about half way between its minimum and maximum. The Moon is different than Mars because it has no atmosphere, but taking all those figures, using an average of 0.25 Sv/yr overall is probably within, say, 50% of the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two - Again using a lot of modeling and statistics, the estimate is that 0.5 Sv/yr increases an astronaut's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight_radiation_carcinogenesis"&gt;chances of cancer&lt;/a&gt; by about 3% to 5%. In order to not increase those chances beyond that amount, radiation dose for a whole career is not to exceed 1 to 4 Sv, depending largely on the age and gender of the astronaut. There isn't enough data to consider other possible health risks due to radiation exposure, and even the figures used are a guesstimate. Actual effects could be much less or much more, they could vary a lot from person to person, and other factors like diet and exercise could change these probabilities greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three - Alright, so if there was no shielding, the estimates we have say that radiation levels would be acceptable for 4 to as much as 16 years. The trouble is, as soon as you put material between a person and the sky, the radiation gets worse - a lot worse - before it starts getting better when the shielding is thick enough. This is because of shrapnel. Cosmic rays are particles, mostly protons, but also the nuclei of a variety of atoms, moving at large fractions of the speed of light. What happens when these particles pass through matter is very complicated. Basically, they pass right through matter until they happen to hit an atomic nucleus. When they do, they smash that nucleus to pieces. The bits smashed apart have enough energy to smash another nucleus once they happen to hit one, and that can happen again, and again, until the energy is dispersed enough that the cascade stops. Because matter is almost entirely empty space, it is sheerly a matter of chance how far through a material these collisions happen. But if the material shielding you isn't thick enough for these cascades to have stopped before they reach you, the shrapnel multiplies the radiation damage you are getting. A recent graph in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI41N-eC7VA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2393"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; shows the radiation dose peaking at 8 times what it is without shielding, and that peak happens when you have about a meter of loose regolith between you and the sky. The dose doesn't drop below what an unshielded person would get until 4 m of regolith is in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay... that was a big preamble, but in order to think clearly about this stuff, you have to know these things. The habitats designed for Cernan's Promise have projected radiation levels well below even 0.05 Sv/yr, which is the &lt;a href="http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/health-effects/info.html"&gt;maximum dose for radiation workers&lt;/a&gt;. If you were to spend a lot of your time in certain spots that get higher exposure, you would exceed that dose, but you'd have to do that for hours a day. So, a conservative approach has been taken. And yet people will be able to look up and see the sky directly, and in the dugout, enough sunlight will enter directly to have a leafy garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGTy98WgQY/V7UCIgHxVKI/AAAAAAAAWPg/sJJCNJE_JN8-y-Si1OSPJ7UUSHQJddaZwCK4B/s1600/solid-W-window-wall.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="350" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGTy98WgQY/V7UCIgHxVKI/AAAAAAAAWPg/sJJCNJE_JN8-y-Si1OSPJ7UUSHQJddaZwCK4B/s400/solid-W-window-wall.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cheated a little by indicating where the sky is in this model by making it sky blue, which is clearly wrong. It would be black and starry, but on many days, you would be able to see the Earth through those gaps, which, if you ask me, makes up for that completely. And there would really be that sense of soft sunlight. What this is, is a series of tall narrow arches, with glass in between. As this colony is on the equator, because the Moon isn't tilted like the Earth is, sunlight would come in all day, every day. It would be a bit indirect because there is a slight angle, but the arches are faced with aluminum foil on their vertical faces so still lots comes in. (Hopefully that aluminum would be mirror smooth, to give a funky infinite mirror reflection effect when you look up into the gap between the arches.) Those are planters behind the figures, and they would be full up with all different plants. (LEDs get them through the night, but that is a different post.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigvart wrote a small &lt;a href="https://github.com/briligg/moonwards/blob/gh-pages/js/dugout.js"&gt;program to estimate the radiation dose in this space&lt;/a&gt;. It generates random rays coming in, tracks the thickness of material each ray passes through, and compares that to the curve shown in the video linked above for radiation levels through different thicknesses of material. That shows that there at the bottom where the figures are the dose is about 0.015 Sv/yr, if you spent all your time there. A third of what radiation workers are permitted on Earth. So, even with variations due to different geometry in different spots, this garden space is super safe. We could space the beams more widely to get more light and save on material - but the heat that comes with it takes some management, so i have left it like this for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the window at the west end of the hall connected to the dugout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-snOgYykaEnE/V7UN8FU9sxI/AAAAAAAAWP8/JZtEE51RvtkG4Qedp2sPToI6EDX4W9RzACK4B/s1600/Aug17.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="280" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-snOgYykaEnE/V7UN8FU9sxI/AAAAAAAAWP8/JZtEE51RvtkG4Qedp2sPToI6EDX4W9RzACK4B/s320/Aug17.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, the grey bar you can see outside reflects in the sky above. The area that directly shows the sky is small, mostly what is visible is Lalande Crater. Again this setup is very conservative. Even the green figure would see little enough of the sky even if the bar wasn't there that it would be pretty safe to stand there for hours every day looking out. But, that bar reflects in the Earth, which i have created views of wherever possible. It has mirrors on it angled so it does so, always, but they haven't been created in the model yet. And also, there is a narrow case where even that amount of sky would be dangerous if that bar wasn't there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When solar particle events occur, ionizing radiation skyrockets for up to a few days. A few hours in that kind of radiation could kill a person. In this structure, if you aren't in the dugout, you are safe. If it should be the unlucky case that the sun was just about to set when it decided to flare on you, it would shine through that window and anything those rays struck would get a serious dose of radiation. But, if that should happen in this design, that bar would be in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuff in the dugout would get a dose if the sun is high when this happens, during most of the year. But there is no need to be in the dugout. The crew would be alerted of the imminent arrival of the ionizing particles by the surge in x-rays that precedes it. &amp;nbsp;The arches and the glass between would stop virtually all the x-rays and a lot of the gamma rays that happen in bursts before such events. They would have a few hours to get the plants into the hall and anything else that might be damaged by the solar storm, then they would hunker down there until it passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we're good here. And we can see outside, for real. I'm telling you, this would be a nice place to live.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/2632294516377304025/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-3.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2632294516377304025'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2632294516377304025'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-3.html' title='Health Tips on the Moon - Part 3'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gcGTy98WgQY/V7UCIgHxVKI/AAAAAAAAWPg/sJJCNJE_JN8-y-Si1OSPJ7UUSHQJddaZwCK4B/s72-c/solid-W-window-wall.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-2282708788616696199</id><published>2016-08-09T11:18:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T07:28:51.909-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Health tips on the Moon - Part 2</title><content type='html'>Before i do anything else i am going to deliberately refer you away from this blog, to the wonderful &lt;a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/124/"&gt;Lunar Swimming&lt;/a&gt; entry on Randall Munroe's What If blog, and please note that i asked that question. Please return for further discussion of the proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All done? Okay, hopefully you noticed the bit that points out 'The inertia of the water is the main source of drag when swimming, and inertia is a property of matter independent of gravity. The top speed of a submerged swimmer would be about the same on the Moon as here—about 2 meters/second'. So, if you can swim, you can load your muscles just as much as they are loaded when you swim on Earth, and swimming is one of the best forms of exercise there is. It develops all your main muscle groups while not straining your joints. The pressure of the water against you could also be useful for encouraging redistribution of fluids, if the low gravity isn't enough to keep the fluids in our body where they ought to be (which it might be, and if it isn't, the water pressure while swimming might not help - speculation here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us come back in a bit to the much more intriguing fact you could leap out of the water like a dolphin, and the splashiness matter, and talk about how else so much water can be useful. And let us also come back to the point that water is heavy and it would take a lot of infrastructure to get the water for large swimming pools to the colony, and more infrastructure still to do the audacious things with them i am about to propose. That is all just a matter of how far along the development path of a colony something like this would make sense. Development timelines change a lot when people decide they want something to happen, thus the relevant thing is to talk about the neatest possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water is excellent radiation protection, and it is transparent. The one-sixth gravity helps a lot in containing large masses of it. So, i propose putting a great big swimming pool right against great big windows, and making as much of the sides and bottom of the pool as possible out of transparent material like quartz, sapphire, or high-strength plastics. &amp;nbsp;Really the only way to practically have large windows on the Moon is to put a few meters of water between you and the outside. 'Practical' is, of course, a relative term. I think it applies here because if you live in a place where going outside means hopping around awkwardly in a stiff space suit and still being stuck seeing everything through a glass pane and not being able touch anything, after a while i bet you aren't going to be very interested in being outside. But if you stay inside, even the considerable effort made so far to create direct or reflected views of the outside will still give you only a narrow vista that is necessarily set a number of meters away. People are going to ache for a panoramic vista that can serve some limited substitution for the great outdoors left behind on Earth. So, this is the option. Until you can cover over entire craters in glass-and-water transparent roofs, which will make all the difference and i wouldn't even recommend settling the Moon if that wasn't completely feasible given enough infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-99jykR2PvS8/V6omxmOK_GI/AAAAAAAAWPM/h_U_PGXfFD07S0ZrRxCw-z2V_pyvGzKMwCK4B/s1600/swimming_pool1000.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-99jykR2PvS8/V6omxmOK_GI/AAAAAAAAWPM/h_U_PGXfFD07S0ZrRxCw-z2V_pyvGzKMwCK4B/s400/swimming_pool1000.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12.8px;"&gt;I give you your deluxe compensation for life in a snazzy box.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The pool sketched in the image is, of course, quite large. 57 m long, 7.5 m wide, 7.3 m deep, for a total of over 3 metric kilotons of water. So, since personally i don't think there will ever be a good reason to mine water at the lunar poles for propellant on any significant scale, here is the good reason to mine that water. Hotels on Earth go to great lengths to provide guests with awesome pools, some of those even have large expanses of load-bearing transparent sections just because it looks cool. The justification here is essentially pretty similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you stayed at least a meter or two from the windows, you could gaze out them to your heart's content with no concern about radiation. Because you would be in that large body of water, the cone where there is so little water that radiation is elevated would be so narrow that the resulting dose is safe. Other tricks have been employed in this cylinder too - it is covered with plenty of regolith, and is under an overhang wide enough that not a lot of sky is visible if, for instance, your head is above water and you are quite close to the windows. A lot of the ground is visible, and scattered ionizing radiation will reach you from there, but that dose should be less than the dose from skywards. (I am going to need to seek numbers for that.) It seems to me that lunar residents are best left to judge for themselves how much time to spend in observation spots that come with a dose of radiation, and i imagine they will manage that without trouble. 10 minutes with a breathtaking view is worth a minor radiation hit a healthy person can manage without trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you hanker getting moving, leap like a dolphin!!! To get up to a good speed at a good angle for an impressive leap, you want a pool this deep, and this long. Let's review the figures for a fit swimmer with flippers - they could leap 2 m out of the water. Oh yeah! I'd be in that pool all the time. This is an environment where you could really tire yourself out with a good race without being painfully aware of how often you have to turn around because of the limited space. It is a place for epic splash fights because droplets would hang in the air 6 times as long. Once i detail the pool i'll add a shelf where triple-decker chicken fights can be conducted, a suitable variety of diving boards, and 3 levels of pool-side lounging area set against its glass walls. The diameter of the cylinder that houses it actually now seems too small. It can only fit a non-springy diving board a measly 4 m above the water and you'd have to watch you didn't jump too high and hit your head on the roof. Clearly this pool requires a spring board at least 15 m above the water, and one would need to expect that jumping off it would launch you another 4 m higher. The architecture will need to be reconsidered...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, exercise on the Moon that would genuinely load your body just like on Earth is entirely possible and would be super super fun. This i think is enough for us to not concern ourselves about muscle and bone wasting as long as people are willing to swim several times a week, which really doesn't seem like it will be a hard sell. There are other possibilities of course, which we can explore once detailed large models of the Gallery are done, like the simple but effective option of having no stairs anywhere and simply jumping between floors. And further out still, with a covered crater model, we can talk about artificial bat wings that allow you to actually fly. Yes, i'm serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, i almost forgot, large amounts of water are also excellent heat sinks, greatly reducing the demands of thermal control. Yeah, that's kind of boring, isn't it... forget i mentioned it...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/2282708788616696199/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-2.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2282708788616696199'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2282708788616696199'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-2.html' title='Health tips on the Moon - Part 2'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-99jykR2PvS8/V6omxmOK_GI/AAAAAAAAWPM/h_U_PGXfFD07S0ZrRxCw-z2V_pyvGzKMwCK4B/s72-c/swimming_pool1000.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8054528403305919452</id><published>2016-08-01T15:34:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T07:29:12.397-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Health tips on the Moon - Part 1</title><content type='html'>I've been mulling how to address effective exercise on the Moon to address a host of health problems that come with low gravity. &amp;nbsp;The&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the_human_body"&gt; main issues&lt;/a&gt; are&amp;nbsp;loss of muscle and bone mass, and problems associated with redistribution of fluids, in particular how this can degrade eyesight. Also with the first habitat model coming along, i took a more critical look at its radiation protection and beefed it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many things, the exercise problem gets a lot easier if you have plenty of space to work with. That is why the first virtual moon colony being made is something pretty developed, to really assess the potential. Two things are being put in for exercise that hopefully could make a big difference. One is a human-powered centrifuge, a variation on the kind used to test human tolerance to high g forces. &lt;a href="http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10258/368_read-7903#/gallery/11951"&gt;One the German space agency has&lt;/a&gt; is shown below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvTPzs4jyG8/V5-HZcb7zYI/AAAAAAAAWN4/BBlA3bKY0r8Eumea43n0tPN5VSpQqcR4ACK4B/s1600/Blut_zentrifuge_l.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="181" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvTPzs4jyG8/V5-HZcb7zYI/AAAAAAAAWN4/BBlA3bKY0r8Eumea43n0tPN5VSpQqcR4ACK4B/s320/Blut_zentrifuge_l.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;You go in the box then it spins real fast&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the low gravity of the Moon, two or three people could slowly spin up something much larger until the effect was like a full gravity pressing people against the outer wall of a connected wheel, like old-fashioned &lt;a href="https://www.google.com.mx/search?q=rotor+amusement+park+ride&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1234&amp;amp;bih=946&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvl53Z4KDOAhVHRCYKHTauDgQQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbs=rimg%3ACcPPdA5pVkF-IjhSiBVNbXDI21zpih0LhLIxkhXL4Q-iS8CbsLlB3c2tb_1Bq-DikBaIBtlKe0ZEFVRbGH5g0ZvjFvSoSCVKIFU1tcMjbEUpbYeT419I4KhIJXOmKHQuEsjERSfWZTWpfWA4qEgmSFcvhD6JLwBEFB1u6AFMGWyoSCZuwuUHdza1vEeTqDpwLtm86KhIJ8Gr4OKQFogER4ezLlgbuap4qEgm2Up7RkQVVFhEB051IrvWpqSoSCcYfmDRm-MW9Edv2JHWxs6Rs&amp;amp;q=rotor%20amusement%20park%20ride&amp;amp;imgrc=x_dX0h7ay4pEdM%3A"&gt;Rotor amusement park rides&lt;/a&gt;. As evidence it really doesn't take that much power to revolve such a structure fast enough, I recall two older boys once had some fun spinning a roundabout, which is similar, so fast that i was no longer strong enough to hold on and went flying off, and i was not the only squealing kid on the ride begging them to stop. Ah, childhood... This is how long-term memories are formed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2mxq_81rqo/V5-Mj57PDII/AAAAAAAAWOI/Q7V3rt-l-e0SlG_QrPEq8MNR9753Yu-UgCK4B/s1600/Tift_Park_merry-go-round.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="237" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H2mxq_81rqo/V5-Mj57PDII/AAAAAAAAWOI/Q7V3rt-l-e0SlG_QrPEq8MNR9753Yu-UgCK4B/s320/Tift_Park_merry-go-round.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Fun ride and torture device&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;So, it seems reasonable that in lunar conditions something that works on the same principle could be spun to the equivalent of one g and kept there by a few people. It would be good aerobic exercise for those keeping it going, time in one g for those who are on it, and it doesn't need any motors or a power supply so it isn't nearly as hard to build.

My 3d model skills are still immature...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;(The spoke support system probably isn't adequate, but this is just a sketch right now.) Notice the 2-level central stand where up to 12 people could cooperate in keeping the wheel spun up, by first leaning against one of those red handles and pushing on it while trotting around the green platform, and then standing around the platform perimeter and hauling on the handles as they pass by. To be useful therapy for the people on the wheel, the speed for the equivalent of 1 gravity probably needs to be maintained for at least, say, a half hour, daily or a few times a week. Typically the human body keeps itself ready for the heaviest loading that is regularly experienced, so it is reasonable to suppose that such a level of exercise would keep lunar residents in decent shape. Crew on the ISS have to exercise much more than that, but they aren't able to do so in artificial gravity. The hope is that would make the key difference. As it is a group activity where everyone benefits, and would likely be sort of fun, it doesn't seem like it would be a problem to arrange for everyone to take turns, sometimes pushing the wheel, and sometimes riding on it. Turning the wheel would provide good aerobic exercise, working out on the wheel would be the anaerobic, strengthening component of their exercise program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be really effective, those on the wheel would need to do exercises while under that force, stuff that loads there bones and muscles well. Squats, push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, lunges, stuff like that. Just being on the wheel though would also be helpful. The crew on the International Space Station have some difficulties because there is no gravity keeping fluids properly distributed in their bodies, and so it collects in their upper bodies and especially in their heads. Pressure on their eyeballs due to that is the leading explanation for the vision problems they often have. Their sinuses also often get clogged. Being on the wheel would provide relief from that. The wheel has a wide enough radius to limit the dizziness people feel on such structures when they move their heads around - in this model it is 12 m. Spending an hour or more on it shouldn't cause nausea, though it might take people a bit to adapt to the sensations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't until we contemplate a space large enough for such an innovation, with the infrastructure in place to create it right there on the Moon so the expense isn't exorbitant, that we can really get our juices flowing and imagine a future colony in detail. This is hopefully a good example of that process. In the next few days i'll post about another very useful exercise option - swimming pools. That implies a lot of infrastructure too, more than this does even. But that is the goal, right? The thing is to outline the path leading there better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8054528403305919452/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-1.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8054528403305919452'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8054528403305919452'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/08/health-tips-on-moon-part-1.html' title='Health tips on the Moon - Part 1'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvTPzs4jyG8/V5-HZcb7zYI/AAAAAAAAWN4/BBlA3bKY0r8Eumea43n0tPN5VSpQqcR4ACK4B/s72-c/Blut_zentrifuge_l.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8626250129605980207</id><published>2016-07-27T10:51:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-27T07:29:31.415-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Getting in Virtual Shape</title><content type='html'>This may not shock anybody, but building an entire virtual Moon colony is a really big job with many challenges. Trying to become more methodical and organized about it has led to a lull in visible output right now. It has also made the stack of tasks on my desktop look that much more daunting. For now. I hear that once a project is properly organized, things go much more smoothly. That would be really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Moonwards.com website was registered a year ago this week. I had been playing with the idea for a few months before that, and was encouraged to actually try it by people i met at the International Space Development Conference in Toronto in May of 2015. My idea of how that would go was really different at the time. Maybe it is typical when someone has an idea they find really exciting that they expect other people to find it equally exciting and hop on board just because one tells them about it. Now i realize that the rich, complex landscape of Moonwards in my head is only visible to me, and although many people find it interesting, they need much better reasons to devote their time to it than my enthusiasm and a small website. Turns out i actually have to figure out how to do this myself, and create the basic framework of it mostly on my own. &lt;i&gt;Then&lt;/i&gt; it will draw people in and the actual doing of it will be shared among a group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, i have actually received a good deal of help considering how preliminary the whole thing is. It very much encourages me to plug on, and has often made me smile. The last few weeks though have been mostly about looking at the 3d models i have built over the last 6 months, and pondering how poorly made they are, and dealing with rebuilding them somewhat professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MnI8NwuNFt8/V5jQZvTAEeI/AAAAAAAAWNo/6Fg1_VxyZIU7LzOCN2xTZSw8e5M4hgzoACK4B/s1600/obsolete.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="257" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MnI8NwuNFt8/V5jQZvTAEeI/AAAAAAAAWNo/6Fg1_VxyZIU7LzOCN2xTZSw8e5M4hgzoACK4B/s400/obsolete.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Can you find the 17 model issues in this picture? Well, i was trying, okay?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out that when people who know 3d modelling toy with volunteering on a project, finding a bunch of rickety problematic models quickly curbs their enthusiasm. Hm. And going to the project's GitHub page and finding it is is mostly unstructured and has lots of obsolete files doesn't help. And while the whiteboard is very helpful to me and a great creative tool, most people want neatly laid out documentation so they can see a roadmap and understand exactly what needs doing and how it all fits together. But in order to do that, i have to stop dead in making things, and spend weeks just on that. Which i have resisted doing because i am super-fidgety to get a rough draft done, and that still seems more important to me. It's like needing to have a prototype done before setting up a production line. I'd still really like more help on the prototype though. Just please excuse the mess...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solar furnace shown on the website is now obsolete and will be deleted in favor of a &lt;a href="http://enu.kz/repository/2010/AIAA-2010-8703.pdf"&gt;Schubert dust roaster&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to briefly talk to Peter Schubert about it at a conference and he seemed happy to have it on the site and will hopefully give me some guidance on it. But i haven't even started that because volunteers came in to work on the models and i tried to get things in shape for them. This is how i know that looked at through their eyes this thing is sort of a mess. Now the dugout and hall habitat models have been greatly improved, and i have learned a lot that will make future work faster and smoother. But i am still doing all the modelling on my own... I think i will take a break from fixing to mock up the dust roaster. Doing stuff like that is so much more satisfying. The rest is a bunch of incomplete models and various important models are missing. As for the homepage, I'm just going to take down the entire set of mission outlines that start half-way down, as they no longer apply and and were just meant as a sketch anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This remains a very difficult thing to do and it has yet to reach its first important goal of being one complete first draft. I hope that plateau provides the sense of security and momentum i am anticipating it will. If the whole thing didn't still strike me as a really great and important thing, i might set it aside. But it is important. If it doesn't flower into a highly popular and inspirational domain, at least it will hopefully be useful to the people who come after and do it right. Because it has to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8626250129605980207/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/getting-in-virtual-shape.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8626250129605980207'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8626250129605980207'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/getting-in-virtual-shape.html' title='Getting in Virtual Shape'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MnI8NwuNFt8/V5jQZvTAEeI/AAAAAAAAWNo/6Fg1_VxyZIU7LzOCN2xTZSw8e5M4hgzoACK4B/s72-c/obsolete.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-3303175945317340366</id><published>2016-07-23T13:31:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-23T13:31:36.529-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Walking Rovers on the Moon</title><content type='html'>Moon dust is super nasty. It is composed of particles of shrapnel, essentially, created during meteor strikes. The only bits that aren't all sharp edges are the blobs of glass from the portion that was thrown up as lava. You want to stay away from it as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when exploring a new world, you need to be able to handle all terrain, from steep crater walls of loose material, to fields of boulders, to deep crevices, to ponds of deep fine dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also your vehicle has to do everything. It will have arms so it can do all the manual labor needed to build, manufacture, repair, prospect... whatever comes up, most of which won't be very predictable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the rovers for Cernan's Promise will take the ATHLETE rover model one step further. They chuck the wheels altogether and walk around, and some of the legs also can be arms. (I can't help but think that is the eventual idea for ATHLETE too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rather like this video for getting across what i mean :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vVblGlIMgw"&gt;The spider-bot that wants to be a rover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thought is to reduce that concept to 6 legs, put mechanisms on two of them so that the bottom joint folds out of the way and hands are deployed for doing any kind of work.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/3303175945317340366/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/walking-rovers-on-moon.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3303175945317340366'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3303175945317340366'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/walking-rovers-on-moon.html' title='Walking Rovers on the Moon'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-2995639245979846481</id><published>2016-07-23T12:10:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-23T12:54:50.434-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Space Show on Conquering the World </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum. It was originally posted there on June 6th, 2016.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/03-jun-2016/broadcast-2712-kim-holder"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; to Friday's episode of The Space Show, where i talked about how the Moon could conquer Earth, and in general about how military acts in space can be extremely effective and hard to prevent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a dark theme i talk about in order to propose a bright future. I believe that it would be by far the healthiest thing for the world to undertake our first extensive venture in space together, in a manner that is as inclusive as possible. This is the only way we can develop the cooperation and trust needed to keep space safe at the same time we create the possibility for it to become very dangerous. No system of laws, treaties, or regulations are going to be enough on their own. They will only work if we build a sense that we have a common interest world-wide in peace, and that can only happen if we feel we've done it together and we are all on the same team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timeline for Cernan's Promise will be based on that approach. I have been focused over the last 8 weeks on building rather complicated models (that i am in fact unsure how to display well on the website, they are that large), preparing for, attending, and doing follow-up emails for the ISDC in Puerto Rico, and getting used to being the new junior moderator on space.stackexchange. I have added some content to the site over the last week and hope to add much more in the next two or three. One of those bits of content is the Residency Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been outlined in the Mission Timelines already (which are screaming for an update, but hey, one does what one can). Basically, any nation can send an astronaut for life to Cernan's Promise for $100 million, and you need at least 200 such astronauts to provide sufficient income for development. There is an overt effort to get astronauts from as many countries as possible as part of this effort, and there are later rounds done on the same model that add more residency spots at increasingly cheaper prices. Once the settlement has a few thousand residents and the price for further spots has decreased to a level a significant percentage of Earth's population could afford, the market is opened to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get across the urgency of doing whatever the first big thing we do in space is, as a world, together, making people realize that we could pay a grave price indeed down the road if we don't is absolutely necessary. So, i've started going on about it whenever the opportunity arises.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/2995639245979846481/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-space-show-on-conquering-world.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2995639245979846481'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2995639245979846481'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-space-show-on-conquering-world.html' title='The Space Show on Conquering the World '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-6477771346237081816</id><published>2016-07-23T12:10:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-23T12:14:24.295-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Hybrid Ice Shuttles</title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://www.moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com &lt;/a&gt;forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on April 22nd, 2016.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nuclear shuttle for transportation of ice from the pole to an equatorial base is limited by the thrust of its engine. That mass must accommodate the mass of the engine and all the other dry mass, and the propellant. What is left in the mass budget then is the payload. Note that fuel required for the return trip must be subtracted as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reasonable delta-v budget for a one-way trip (including some gravity losses) is 3200 m/s.&lt;br /&gt;For all my examples, I am going to use a hypothetical but realistic nuclear engine, at 2500kg, 100kN and an Isp of 950s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using hydrogen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can calculate the required mass ratio:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--7vJaMmnAMw/V5PAuu-8PnI/AAAAAAAAWNY/bRabcxN81dU7bNXYoAuL1qiol50OQbcbgCK4B/s1600/201604220847455719e531aef31.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="68" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--7vJaMmnAMw/V5PAuu-8PnI/AAAAAAAAWNY/bRabcxN81dU7bNXYoAuL1qiol50OQbcbgCK4B/s320/201604220847455719e531aef31.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, using a thrust to weight ratio of 2, the launch mass of the shuttle can 30,800 kg. (Scale as desired by adding more engines).&lt;br /&gt;From the mass ratio, we get that 21,800kg of that can be used for the dry mass, payload and return trip fuel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using water:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, why use water? After all, the Isp of water is only 45% of hydrogen. But, even though the mass ratio gets a lot worse, water allows us to get more thrust from the same engine. In a NTR, thrust is simply inversely proportional to the Isp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the same configuration with a T/W ratio of 2 allows us to increase the launch mass to 70,800kg. The mass ratio is 2.2, but that still gives us 32200kg for dry mass, etc. Absolutely an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we can do better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra thrust we get from the water is only required for the first part of the burn. After the shuttle has depleted some of its propellant, it is light enough that if you then switch to hydrogen, the T/W ratio is still good. (Also note that an high T/W ratio is not that important when you have gained a significant fraction of orbital velocity, making it even more favorable to switch propellant mid-burn.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, for instance, we use water for the first km/s of the ascent burn, and for the last 200 m/s of the landing burn, and hydrogen for the remaining 2km/s mid-flight. That results isn 37,300kg for the dry mass etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrust when needed, efficiency when possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;My reply:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;This is great, Sigvart, you have started my day off quite well for me. And you have taught me an essential new emoticon :[)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;That idea i talked to you about the other day, of moving the colony to Aristillus, is one i really didn't want to take on, at least not right now. This issue of transport of material between the pole and the base was what had driven me to consider it. Aristillus is at 33 degrees N latitude, meaning a one way hop would take about 10% less fuel than a trip to Lalande on the equator. As a double sub-orbital hop to get to Lalande and then fly back takes so much fuel, you and Russell had warned me very little space would be left for payload. But water (and carbon chemicals, and ammonia, and the rest) is so darned useful. Even though i think setting up a fuel depot is a low priority, i keep thinking of amazing things to do with water. Lots and lots of water. And those other things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;There are two things i think will make the colony flourish, especially once people are there. If you do it well, broadcasting can bring in 2 or 3 billion dollars a year. And you sell permanent residence in the colony for $100 million a pop. I see residence sales working in the early days mostly because it should be an international sponsorship process. You announce to the world that any nation can send permanent residents of their choosing for that price, and you focus on assembling an initial population that is as representative as possible. Those residents are then representatives of their countries, like Olympic athletes, like astronauts are today. Lots of countries would be attracted to the prestige of that - years and years of national pride and inspiration for one relatively low price, all things considered. And you'd get an almost ideal initial population as well. The best and brightest. The diplomats, the figureheads of a way of life, a way of seeing life and our place in the universe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;Yeah - so, water. For those things above to work, they must come to live in a beautiful place, a place just about anyone would be happy to live. People's impression of how worthwhile it is to live in space, how rewarding the experience could be, will be based on what they see in these broadcasts and the feeling they pick up from those residents. There are so many cool things you can do with water to make the colony more inviting, but you need a lot of it. There is, of course, the classic &lt;a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/124/"&gt;What If? lunar swimming pool scenario&lt;/a&gt;. There are water walls and water domes - 5 m of water is pretty good radiation shielding. There are natural ponds that both provide a sense of nature and do some of the work of recycling waste water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;To do those things on a proper scale requires several thousand tons of water. Some of it will therefore wait for the installation of coil guns at both the equator and the pole. Because really, you can't go too far with this idea. Lakes. A lunar lake, if you are putting in an actual town, you've gotta have one. A dome over a whole crater - good ol' Teacup Crater gets that treatment first. That will take 350,000 tons of water. After that you can stand below that dome and see the sky all around, and sort of feel like you are outside, unencumbered by a space suit, for the first time on another planet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;Oh - Aristillus. It is also a KREEP hotspot. Perhaps it can get the second full colony, but i think we are too far along to move the colony again, and actually, i think there is a decent argument against it. The likelihood of an ilmenite deposit is much higher at Lalande, based on Clemintine data of TiO2 on the surface. Concentration of TiO2 is much higher at Lalande than at Aristillus. ilmenite gets water and iron when reacted with hydrogen. Aristillus also looks a lot older and doesn't have the wonderfully clean walls that Lalande has, that look so very much like the digging depth to get to bedrock isn't much. And the equator has a big advantage if you start doing stuff with tethers, whether you go through EML1 or make a lunavator. So Lalande it is. Which is also nice because i've become quite fond of Lalande after looking at it so much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;Things are shaping up nicely :)&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/6477771346237081816/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/hybrid-ice-shuttles.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6477771346237081816'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6477771346237081816'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/hybrid-ice-shuttles.html' title='Hybrid Ice Shuttles'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--7vJaMmnAMw/V5PAuu-8PnI/AAAAAAAAWNY/bRabcxN81dU7bNXYoAuL1qiol50OQbcbgCK4B/s72-c/201604220847455719e531aef31.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8653966908637853932</id><published>2016-07-23T11:45:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-23T11:45:19.017-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Sunken Hall (Extensive Edit)</title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on April 2nd, 2016.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New and improved! All the external main stuff looked at. Here are a bunch of images of this key ingredient to the colony concept, an excavated space reinforced with fused basalt material and turned into a nice, bright, quite large habitation space. Man building this took a lot longer than i thought it would. But i think i'm getting faster with these things. I was going to talk about each image but that effort would probably be better applied to the main page of the website, with the whole marker and tooltip setup. Though this model is really getting into the territory where it would be much better to have a 3d model people can rotate and move around in, or you don't see how it all works together or the details. In fact i'm not sure it would be helpful to put up all these images, as there are so many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, a couple of highlights. The berms of material around the sides of the area with the arched roof ensure there is no direct view of the sky from the sides, cutting the radiation dose down to something safe, even over decades and even if you spend half your time in that area. The bottom image shows how a view of the sky is visible between the beams of that area, which i call the dugout. You get a significant dose of radiation from that direction due to that, but because you are so well protected from other directions it doesn't endanger you. All the beams have the same gap, so you can walk from end to end of that area, always have a view of the sky above you, and always have natural sunlight falling on you (minus the UV and gamma ray spectrum). The area is very well adapted for growing plants. The idea is gone over more in &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/forum/index.php?id=61"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. Also through the windows at the end of both the tunneled sunken hall and the end of the dugout, a mirror has been set up that reflects in a view of the Earth. The Earth moves only a little in the Moon's sky, and does so quite slowly, because of the way the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth. Those mirrors will always keep the Earth in view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the interior has been modeled yet, of course. I just put in the two airlocks and the structure. Doing the interior will be fun. The space is 40 m long, 30 m wide at the top and 15 m wide at the bottom, by 20 m high, in the dugout area. The hall area (the tunneled part) is 78 m long, 27 m wide, and 13 m high. There is all kinds of space to play with, and all kinds of things that are possible in that space that have never been possible before in, uh, space. I have been playing with ideas for exercises that take advantage of the room. On the Moon if you have enough distance, you can jump high enough to load your muscles and bones the way they are loaded on Earth. That might be very helpful to reducing health issues due to low gravity. You can leave large enough areas open to give something of a feel of the outdoors, or at least large enough not to feel positively claustrophobic after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xWlnE5TH3H8/V5O5kZa_m7I/AAAAAAAAWMc/3Nb5jHXCx_wNez1idXwO8SkPIKpF9Mg8ACK4B/s1600/2016040118501956fec2ebd4dcc.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xWlnE5TH3H8/V5O5kZa_m7I/AAAAAAAAWMc/3Nb5jHXCx_wNez1idXwO8SkPIKpF9Mg8ACK4B/s320/2016040118501956fec2ebd4dcc.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That outside door you see on the airlock is actually 6 m tall by 5.3 m wide. The other airlock, in the dugout, also has a door that is much larger than an ordinary door. Don't let them fool you as to scale, they were just made very large so they can accommodate anything that might need to be brought inside. Use the little green men in the image below for scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L8kTaA5CbLc/V5O6WRy52RI/AAAAAAAAWMk/D4W6ZLUDk1U81AImSllJlmm16Vl4sL_XwCK4B/s1600/2016040118521456fec35e6ee71.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="228" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L8kTaA5CbLc/V5O6WRy52RI/AAAAAAAAWMk/D4W6ZLUDk1U81AImSllJlmm16Vl4sL_XwCK4B/s320/2016040118521456fec35e6ee71.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AXMPT6HolWY/V5O6Y5yKEyI/AAAAAAAAWMs/CUzkU4y336gZWN0By7ut5HEztF4bTcYfwCK4B/s1600/2016040118525156fec383541d9.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="228" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AXMPT6HolWY/V5O6Y5yKEyI/AAAAAAAAWMs/CUzkU4y336gZWN0By7ut5HEztF4bTcYfwCK4B/s320/2016040118525156fec383541d9.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jc_wri2A0ic/V5O6btAsrkI/AAAAAAAAWM0/ubU9Ray-biAH2LX_uljWOo5d4J2Tu4WDQCK4B/s1600/20160402210026570032ea3d7a6.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="228" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jc_wri2A0ic/V5O6btAsrkI/AAAAAAAAWM0/ubU9Ray-biAH2LX_uljWOo5d4J2Tu4WDQCK4B/s320/20160402210026570032ea3d7a6.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EyCfvyAv81Y/V5O6drPauSI/AAAAAAAAWM8/fjA8j8WDftosQqiMYZIZI-CCHQPMX8oggCK4B/s1600/20160402210447570033ef8472f.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="228" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EyCfvyAv81Y/V5O6drPauSI/AAAAAAAAWM8/fjA8j8WDftosQqiMYZIZI-CCHQPMX8oggCK4B/s320/20160402210447570033ef8472f.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mz2h8Dh8vds/V5O6fuivGgI/AAAAAAAAWNI/TPbvKI7uMIYmWqq9cQGBztCjW-3-70hawCK4B/s1600/20160402205923570032aba06d9.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="228" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mz2h8Dh8vds/V5O6fuivGgI/AAAAAAAAWNI/TPbvKI7uMIYmWqq9cQGBztCjW-3-70hawCK4B/s320/20160402205923570032aba06d9.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transparent areas will indeed all be windows. I don't care what they cost, the views are critical to maintaining mental health. And i don't think they will be that expensive, actually. They can be made of laminated sheets of sapphire, which isn't terribly expensive these days. The images show pretty large spans without reinforcement - actually the biggest open spans would be the squares shown with a reinforcing brace halfway vertically and horizontally, making the unsupported area about a meter square. That's about 1.1 tons each would have to bear if a full atmosphere was inside (and to start it would likely be more like two thirds of an atmosphere). Most would have 3 braces, vertically and horizontally, for spans of 50 cm. For the area of windows shown, for each centimeter thick the glazing is, it will mass 3.2 t. I really don't know how to assess how thick it needs to be to bear the pressure of an atmosphere across a span of a meter or 50 cm. If all of it was 2 cm thick, that is 6.4 t. That really seems worth it for how gorgeous it will be. One of the main undertakings in the early days will be broadcasting and film, a gorgeous place really helps with the success of that. Aside from how mentally refreshing that view would be. The windows looking out over Lalande crater would show you a big section of the crater interior. The dugout windows would only show you the Earth in the mirror, but you'd be able to see it throughout the whole dugout space. And besides, it occurred to me later probably most of that outer wall should be mirrored, for a wider view of the sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The arched beams over the dugout are held down at each end by those great big long solid beams with the series of holes along them. The holes show where anchors would been bored deep into the regolith, 3 from each hole at different angles. There is a technique for that that comes from putting together two promising techniques. Both are of course untested, but seem promising. &lt;a href="http://www.isruinfo.com/docs/microwave_sintering_of_lunar_soil.pdf"&gt;Microwave Sintering of Lunar Soil&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_bases/LSBchapter07.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks&amp;amp;page=32"&gt; In-Situ Rock Melting Applied To Lunar Base&lt;/a&gt;. You melt through the regolith with a microwave emitter on the end of a long tube, down as deep as you can go, hopefully at least 20 m. The lava produced is forced out by displacement, and a hollow tube through the regolith is the end result. The microwave emitter sits at the bottom of the tube for a while melting a puddle of regolith around it. Any voids left are back-filled with lava. Deep strong anchors under the long beam on either side of the dugout is the end result. The thick basalt fiber cables running along the top of each beam are attached to these anchors. Similar anchors under the floor of the hall are also made and used to anchor the arches above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8653966908637853932/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-sunken-hall-extensive-edit.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8653966908637853932'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8653966908637853932'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-sunken-hall-extensive-edit.html' title='The Sunken Hall (Extensive Edit)'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xWlnE5TH3H8/V5O5kZa_m7I/AAAAAAAAWMc/3Nb5jHXCx_wNez1idXwO8SkPIKpF9Mg8ACK4B/s72-c/2016040118501956fec2ebd4dcc.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-3873926165857867203</id><published>2016-07-23T11:30:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-23T11:46:53.943-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Polar Ice Shuttle</title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Mar 19th, 2016.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;by Sigvart Brendberg:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The location of the Cernan's Promise lunar base has several important benefits, however, access to lunar volatiles is unfortunately not one of them. Therefore, there is a need for transporting ice from the poles to the equator. Currently, the most realistic way to do that is a reusable shuttle, performing a suborbital hop. The optimal trajectory, as described by Hop David here, has a Delta-v cost for take-off and landing at 3131 m/s. (from now on set to 3200 m/s for a little margin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;LH2/LOX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The propellant for the shuttle should be derived from the mines ice, as it has to be independent of imported resources (which would make it a net loss). For a pure chemical system, LH2/LOX is what we have. Most modern upper stages has a total-to-dry-mass ratio around 12, so a ratio of 10 for our shuttle should work as a reasonable assumption. For the Isp of a LH2/LOX system, ~455s, the required one-way mass ratio is 2.05 . That means that the shuttle should be able to transport a payload of 28 % of its launch mass. Further optimizations are however possible, most notably the fact that oxygen can be produced locally at Cernan's Promise, so the important part of the shuttle payload is hydrogen. Even the oxygen for the return trip can be refuelled there. Thus, assuming a fuel to oxidizer ratio of 4.5, it is able to deliver 37% of its launch mass in hydrogen, in total supplying the base with 330% of its launch mass in water. (Not a typo!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nuclear/LH2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuclear rocket engines are ready, in fact, they have been ready for over 40 years! I chose to use the RD-0410 prototype engine for reference: &amp;lt;engine Isp="910s" thrust="35.3kN" mass="2000kg" src="Soviet Union"&amp;gt; I assume technological progression can easily squeeze 50kN out of that prototype. If we want a trust to weight ratio of 1.5 on the shuttle, the total mass should be 20 tons, with a dry mass of approximately 3800 kg. Payload mass: 43%, water: 380%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nuclear/LH2/LOX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the nuclear engine mostly suffers from, that makes it not that much more payload efficient over all, is that its relatively low thrust gives it a poor total-to-dry-mass ratio. Introducing LOX to the exhaust gives an almost three times higher thrust, while reducing the Isp to 650s. That should bring the total to dry mass ratio back to around 10. If it uses the LOX for the whole trip to the base, that gives a payload ratio of 46%, but high thrust is not required for the whole duration of the burn, so shifting to the high gear for about half of it gives 50% ! In the end, 450% water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;My reply:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;I really like the thinking of transporting just the hydrogen. I worry a little that oxygen production will be slow enough that it will take a long time to produce enough to combine it with all the hydrogen to produce water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;The paper i've used for very roughly estimating the characteristics of the solar furnace is this one by Constance Senior, written in the 1991. Since here the relevant topic is how long it would take to produce the oxygen to make water out of the delivered hydrogen, i went looking for something else and found a pretty great paper, which will also be part of a new solar furnace post - this one by John Matchett, written in 2006. 71 pages of pyrolysis goodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lk6IXuK0KDk/V5O2uigjX-I/AAAAAAAAWMQ/8pwh8S4vKKg3wZjz4u_z8KDWjjMmAdL3QCK4B/s1600/2016031918322456ed9b38efcde.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="205" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lk6IXuK0KDk/V5O2uigjX-I/AAAAAAAAWMQ/8pwh8S4vKKg3wZjz4u_z8KDWjjMmAdL3QCK4B/s400/2016031918322456ed9b38efcde.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;The sample size was very small, under 40 grams. The applicable test is really only the last one, which used regolith simulant. 10% of that vaporized away in a little under an hour. The size of the lens relative to the sample was maybe a bit bigger than the mirror on the solar furnace, but the solar furnace will probably manage a higher energy flux, maintain a better focus, and will be operating in a vacuum where less heat is transported away. So i'm going to call it even and ignore various differences in terms of scale and setup for the sake of coming up with starting-point numbers. And again, a number of differences besides this will be discussed in a solar furnace post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;The tank on the solar furnace holds about 1.5 m3, but it will be hard to fill it completely to the top. I'm going to call it 1.3 m3. It will be loose regolith, which has a bulk density of about 1.3 g/cm3 - might be able to pack in more mass by putting in mostly chunks instead of powder, but we'll go with that. So that's 1.7 t per charge. At the bottom page 15 of the pdf of the Senior paper, she estimates yields of 0.02 to 0.2 g of oxygen per gram of soil. She postulated a very different design, and didn't have the benefit of experimental results from a prototype, instead using extrapolations of results from related experiments. I'm going to pick a figure in the middle of 0.1 g O2 / g of regolith. I'll also say that we evaporate away half of the charge before emptying the tank and refilling it. So that would mean we get 10% of 0.85 t of regolith out as O2, which is 85 kg. If the figure of 10% of the charge vaporizing in an hour held true, that would only take 5 hours. To account for the tasks of processing, maintenance, and put in a healthy margin for error, i'll say 10 hours. At that rate, working around the clock (which will be standard), over one lunar day we could do that 34 times, which is a total of 2890 kg of O2, and i'll round that down to 2.8 tons of O2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;If i take my understanding of your terms (danger!), then 50% payload for nuclear using hydrolox fuel is half of 20 tons, so 10 tons. Some of that is going to be pressure cylinders to hold the hydrogen, probably a few of them, because of the way they need to be processed on either end. Those cylinders need to handle long-term storage in the lunar environment - several days at least. I'm going to say they account for 1 ton of the payload. So that's 9 tons of H2, which needs 72 tons of O2 to convert it all to water. At 2.8 tons per month, it would take 26 months to produce enough oxygen. And also we need to have the oxygen ready to refuel the shuttle, so that's another 3400 kg of O2 (i think).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sigvart:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Just a little comment on the shuttle calculations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That "maximum total mass" is just because of the limited thrust of the nuclear engine I used as an example. That number is really just used to find an acceptable number for the total-to-dry mass ratio for the all nuclear system. Of course, the shuttle can be made large (or smaller). What matters are the percentages at the end. The results should be (roughly) scalable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the nuclear/LH2/LOX, the thrust limitations can pretty much be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the great differences does not seem to lay in the propulsion system design, as producing the required oxygen at Cernan's Promise is boosting the payload 800% ! (+ a little more for not having to transport the oxygen for the return trip.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really looking forward to see what throughput the solar furnace ends up with, but I suspect that the limiting production rate would be the electrolysis at the poles anyway. (To be determined though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another consideration that may have an impact on the design is that event though hydrogen has a much better Isp than water, there may be benefits of using water for the first km/s or so: Despite the lover Isp, it is way denser, so for some substitution, the Delta-v actually increases due to the much better mass ratio (using the same tank space). Secondly, for the same reactor power, water has a higher thrust than hydrogen (inversely proportional to Isp). That extra thrust allows for a larger launch mass, and therefore also a smaller part of that mass being the propulsion system. (Better total-to-dry mass ratio). On top of that, straight water requires less processing to produce, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;Me:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9; font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;Oh - a potential solution: reduction of ilmenite by hydrogen to produce water, iron, and titanium dioxide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;FeTiO3 + H2 &amp;gt; Fe + TiO2 + H2O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ie00057a005?journalCode=iecred&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/ResourcesNearEarthSpace/resources07.pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a2c4c9;"&gt;Gotta go do something else, but i wanted to get that down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/3873926165857867203/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-polar-ice-shuttle.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3873926165857867203'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3873926165857867203'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-polar-ice-shuttle.html' title='The Polar Ice Shuttle'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lk6IXuK0KDk/V5O2uigjX-I/AAAAAAAAWMQ/8pwh8S4vKKg3wZjz4u_z8KDWjjMmAdL3QCK4B/s72-c/2016031918322456ed9b38efcde.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8484994200291058486</id><published>2016-07-23T10:29:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-23T10:30:21.350-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Leap day for celebrating leaps! </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Mar 1st, 2016.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now that the Space Show interview is done, time to tear apart the Planning page and redo it as something more focused and useful. I'm deciding how to do that now and it will take some Javascript, so it won't be fast, especially as i only know basic JS right now and haven't practiced much. This time i'll do the work on CodePen and upload working versions to GitHub, so that if people have anything to say about it or want to add or change it, they can. Just register here and at GitHub (if you aren't already there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New people coming in here see a long list of posts by mostly me, and recently a handful by Sigvart. Please don't let that hold you back from saying or asking what is on your mind. I'm learning, the site is young, and there is much to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the day i'd be on TSS because it was leap day. For the past few leap days i've thought to myself, this is a day for a very special holiday, one that is more intense because it only happens once every 4 years. I think it should be a day for celebrating leaps - the turning points in human history when something happened that led to great changes. David Livingston mentioned Copernicus yesterday as such a thing. I also think of the steam engine, powered flight, radio, e=mc2, the discovery of the Americas, the invention of photography... It would be a great day for celebrating those special moments when an event enables the human spirit to suddenly expand, and those special moments are brought by great thinkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The space advocacy movement is a strong nucleus of people who believe in those leaps, and i think by making Feb 29 a holiday for celebrating them, Leap Day would become a way of reaching out to the general populace and encouraging them to value leaps as well. Because the more we focus on them and value them, the easier it is for them to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leap we 'space cadets' pine for is a full, proper, committed leap into space. We have lacked a way to really present that to people who don't know a lot about the science and engineering behind that, people who therefore have misgivings about how much would be gained for such a vast investment. What better way than to put on a party that honors the spirit of it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, i say we do something next Leap Day to really mark that message, and celebrate it as hard as we can. I vote for a parade. Okay, it is a cold time of year in a lot of places, but that has the advantage that there are no competing festivals. Besides, the end of winter has always lacked a decent holiday to brighten the cold and gray. And St. Patrick's really doesn't do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, i say we have a parade. Something interactive for extra fun, and subtly educational. Something that gets the blood moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what city should we pick for the first such parade? San Francisco, home of Google, Tesla, and Silicon Valley?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8484994200291058486/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_23.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8484994200291058486'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8484994200291058486'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_23.html' title='Leap day for celebrating leaps!

It was originally posted there on Feb 28th, 2016.)  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Sigvart Brendberg:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Lunavators is an approaching topic, so I just threw up the basics here if anyone is interested&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major concern in space travel is not distances, but change in velocity, commonly called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v"&gt;delta v&lt;/a&gt;. A spacecraft is limited by its delta-v budget, governed by the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation"&gt;rocket equation&lt;/a&gt; that has a nasty exponential nature. For example, a spacecraft taking off or landing on the Moon typically needs to be half propellant, with regular chemical engines. Thus, spacecraft are normally mostly fuel, and less of everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tethers, when completed, provides an efficient way of cheating the troublesome equation, what if you could just climb down to the Moon? The bottom part of the elevator is anchored to the surface, so the momentum of the spacecraft is simply transferred to that enormous chunk of rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem: Why does not the Lunavator simply fall down? That is after all our everyday experience. The classical approach to this problem is to use the spin of the planet to counteract gravity. (Try to spin around with a rope). However, that does not work for the Moon, as it spins way to slowly. Instead, the elevator extends to a point between the Earth and the Moon called EML1, a place where Earth's and the Moon's gravity cancels out, and together with the inertia creates a place where a thing would remain fixed relative to both the Moon and Earth. A nice place for a space station. From there, a counterweight can be lowered down into the gravity well of Earth. The lower end is also of interest because it moves slower than orbital velocity, making it possible to just "jump off" and re-enter the atmosphere. In other words, a free return from the Moon. Of course, it also works in reverse, making it possible to climb from a transfer orbit to the surface of the Moon. The total one-way delta-v saved is about 2500 m/s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The math is not that horrifying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cable is stretched, so the cable strength we look for is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"&gt;ultimate tensile strength&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the density of it is important, the lighter the better. The combined metric for how good a material is as a tether, strength divided by density, gets the unit m^2/s^2, sometimes called Yuri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same unit that we use for the requirements for the tether, acceleration over a distance. Simply put, you take the acceleration profile over the whole tether span, and finds the area under the graph by integration. This is also a quantity in m^2/s^2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be put into the tether equation, R = e^(requirement in Yuris / tether strength in Yuris). R is here the ratio of the cross sections at the start and at the end of the tether. If this ratio is very large, the material is too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One promising material is Zylon. At a tensile strength of 5800 MPa and a density of only 1560 kg/m^3, it ends up at 3.7 mega-Yuri. That is good compared to the potential between EML1 and the lunar surface, 2.7 mega-Yuri. The end result is a taper ratio of 2.1, perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;My reply:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;That anchored lunar elevator concept is especially exciting, as it would basically be a highway into space. However it would weigh so much that a lot of infrastructure would need to exist in order to build it. Maybe it should be the thing in the Phase 3 Mission 1 section, instead of taking over the world. I was reading a bit about this the other day and it was mentioned that because the Moon's orbit isn't exactly circular, and other variants such as the tug of the sun, Jupiter, and Venus, and irregularities in the gravitational field of the Moon, the EML1 point moved around a fair bit. I went and found where - it was this Orbiter forum thread (where Hop David shows up, surprise, surprise). So the station will require significant orbital maintenance and will need to move continuously to stay in the right relationship to all the elements. But it still is a much easier project than an equivalent elevator from the surface of the Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The rotating 'skyhook' version, credited to Hans Moravic, allows for a system with much smaller mass that does something similar on a much smaller scale. It can be in a low orbit around the Moon and by rotating the whole structure as it orbits, one end can touch the lunar surface with no relative velocity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rl4yysg3poA/V5OiZuX0YQI/AAAAAAAAWLo/5VkafVw9GL4xxGaZwzUA0NkmamlB01qUgCK4B/s1600/Cycloid_f.gif" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rl4yysg3poA/V5OiZuX0YQI/AAAAAAAAWLo/5VkafVw9GL4xxGaZwzUA0NkmamlB01qUgCK4B/s320/Cycloid_f.gif" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The clever additions by Robert Hoyt to this design allows for a tether 200 km long with a counterweight on one end and a travelling station or hub that moves up and down the tether to transfer momentum from the Moon to the Lunavator. (That's what he called his specific design, though i agree it's so catchy we should just use it for all lunar tether systems.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vIykT_WX99U/V5OjT0syDEI/AAAAAAAAWLw/dwoA4Me4L9kv_hj0sbeDPUDXdbs_rzy2ACK4B/s1600/2016022821180956d36411e3c2c.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="245" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vIykT_WX99U/V5OjT0syDEI/AAAAAAAAWLw/dwoA4Me4L9kv_hj0sbeDPUDXdbs_rzy2ACK4B/s400/2016022821180956d36411e3c2c.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Not that i have yet read his paper properly, but i can't find what material he was using in his calculations. I imagine it was Zylon. At any rate, the tether mass in his design is listed as only 4706 kg. (I like it that he didn't round that to 4700 kg.) It is so light that just one Falcon Heavy could launch not only the tether but also the rest of the system, considering that there is no need to land on the Moon. So maybe the first Lunavator should indeed be done that way. Still - there is soooo much basalt to be had on the Moon, and it may be up to the job, if not as good as Zylon. Sure, it is twice as dense. But getting it where you want it takes about a fifth of the delta v.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There are few sources on basalt tensile strength and what they say is highly variable. The particular source of basalt makes a big difference, from what i've read. This page by Dr Alexander Novyskyi seems to give a fair treatment of the subject. There is a chart on that page shown below that makes clear how much the particular basalt used and the process technology affect final strength.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jHAb-pH8e4c/V5OkCKi3gzI/AAAAAAAAWL8/nvbu8DCNyCUcYU2Q2bWFlB4KDqCDixnOgCK4B/s1600/2016022821415756d369a501368.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="258" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jHAb-pH8e4c/V5OkCKi3gzI/AAAAAAAAWL8/nvbu8DCNyCUcYU2Q2bWFlB4KDqCDixnOgCK4B/s320/2016022821415756d369a501368.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;That product 2nd from bottom has a pretty good tensile strength, the two above it aren't too shabby either. And note this quote from the accompanying article:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;'An important step in obtaining quality is melt degassing process which involves the removal of gas held in the melt. This process takes place upon exposure of the melt at temperatures above 1720 K. The duration of exposure is about two hours.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Degassing you say? Well, the Moon will have no problem with that at all. In fact, this brings up again the speculation that lunar glasses may be significantly stronger than Earth glasses in general because they are completely anhydrous. &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_bases/LSBchapter07.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks&amp;amp;page=53"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; by James Blacic rather gushes about that. (There is a lot of other fascinating stuff in that booklet too.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Which development route to take... much to ponder...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sigvart:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole rotating tether set-up have momentum, and we pick up something that stands still on the surface. Afterwards, the combined mass of the two must have orbital velocity, in order to not crash into the ground. We want the resulting orbit to be circular. We can manage to do that by either drop mass when picking up the payload, or initially having an elliptic orbit. Of course, we can chose to only lift payloads that are much smaller than the tether mass to approximate the orbit as a circle. The core principle does however remain, we balance cargo up and down from the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the tether orbits at an altitude of 100 km, the end of the tether has to rotate at 1720 m/s in order to be able to catch the payload. Let us see what the acceleration is then:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1720 m/s * 1720 m/s)/100000 m = 29.6 m/s^2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is over 3 g. Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;And when we pick up the payload, we have lunar gravity too. (In total 31.2 m/s^2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great opportunity to present another fundamental property of tethers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tether mass is proportional to tether-end acceleration. (for the same payload)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even if a skyhook is shorter than an anchored tether, it has to be much ticker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next: Taper ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The potential (in m^2/s^2, Yuri) caused by the rotation is simply the tether length times half the tether-end acceleration. For the low lunar orbit tether:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;29.6 m/s^2 * 1/2 * 100000 m = 1.48 mega-Yuri&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite substantial. In comparison, the potential caused by the lunar gravity over the 100 km is just 0.155 mega-Yuri.&lt;br /&gt;Although a smaller item, we must consider that too. Taper ratio with Zylon fibre:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R = e^(1.64 MY / 3.7 MY) = 1.56&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An improvement over the anchored tether, but the almost 20 times larger acceleration causes a 20 times larger cross section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A longer tether, for example orbiting at 200 km, has a tether-end acceleration of 15.65 m/s^2 and a taper ratio of 1.58 (very close to the ratio for 100 km).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;500 km: acceleration 6.48 m/s^2 and R of 1.65&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the mass of the skyhook tether is almost independent of the orbital altitude (unless very high or low), but a higher altitude reduces the acceleration giving more time to make the catch.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/4109650028619534458/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/let-us-get-lunavator-thread.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4109650028619534458'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4109650028619534458'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/let-us-get-lunavator-thread.html' title='Let us get a Lunavator thread '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rl4yysg3poA/V5OiZuX0YQI/AAAAAAAAWLo/5VkafVw9GL4xxGaZwzUA0NkmamlB01qUgCK4B/s72-c/Cycloid_f.gif' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-1094115607872549373</id><published>2016-07-22T17:39:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T17:41:22.286-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Long range plans of all sorts </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Feb 28th, 2016.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added lots of stuff to the mission timelines over the last few days, and today tossed in a bouquet of ideas of many sorts. &lt;a href="http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/29-feb-2016/broadcast-2656-kiim-holder"&gt;I am on the Space Show&lt;/a&gt; on Monday afternoon (2pm PST, 5pm EST, 10pm GST), and wanted to broaden the menu as much as i could in advance. So, i hashed out very, very brief outlines of missions going out far into the future, out into the times when the Moon will be a boomtown with extraordinary scope. The timeline roughly goes to 30 years or so after the first mission lands, accelerating sharply in development speed as it goes. I think this needs to be expected, as by the time the current timeline ends, robotics will be highly advanced. Most labor by then will be executed by independent machines acting almost entirely without supervision or interference, and very little of the mass of those robots will come from Earth. It is only the briefest of outlines of those missions, but it gives a sense of the giddy potential there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to note. I named a few of the installations further out, big things like space stations deserving of a name. Those names come from the family names of people who have contributed to Moonwards so far. This is one little way i can recognize these people, do a little something for them that might actually be seen a lot in the future if things go well. Thus we have Brendberg Station for Sigvart Brendberg, Lynch Spaceport for Brian Lynch, Garcia Lunavator for my husband Aldo Garcia, and Holder Lunavator for me, because hey, we're a pair, and so that the pattern is maybe more clear if people are missing it. As time goes on, i'll give names in the same way to various things in the project. Of course this is only a taste of how in the future credit markers will be on everything. I thought about calling them 'plaques', like how buildings and monuments have plaques talking about their creators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now to explain this lunavator thing. Basalt fiber cable is something the colony should have little trouble manufacturing in bulk early on. There is a lack of good documentation regarding the strength of such cable, but the little there is suggests this stuff makes great rope. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; says its ultimate tensile strength is 4.8 GPa, compared to 5.8 GPa for Zylon, and 3.8 for Kevlar. That's really high. It is a preliminary number and must be treated with caution, but not so much caution that i can't get a little starry-eyed over it. At any rate if basalt rope doesn't cut it for this, further out something else will. Might be harder to make on the Moon though, for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tethers.com/papers/LDC00Cislunar.pdf"&gt;This document&lt;/a&gt;, from Robert Hoyt of Tethers Unlimited, looks at a really great version of what you could do on the Moon with an orbiting tether on page 9. The whole document makes delicious reading, an excellent treatment of tether launch systems. I love me a good tether. The paper was done under grant from NIAC, the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, so its quality is high. The idea is a tether with a total length of 200 km makes clever use of a counterweight and a station on the tether that travels its length in order to manage angular momentum. This way the tether can be made to meet the surface of the Moon at essentially no relative speed, pick up or drop off a payload, and swing back up into space. And it can do that again and again. Its capacity to move payload is high. It will orbit the Moon once every 90 minutes, so if everything is clicking, it grabs a payload once every 90 minutes. If what it can handle is 1 ton, then it can launch 16 tons every day, day in and day out. Even better, there is an extremely clever way to transfer momentum between the tether and the Moon so that the Lunavator doesn't need to expend propellant to adjust its orbit. It just takes a break every now and then to focus on swinging itself up to the orbital speed it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;200 km doesn't seem so very long if you are making basalt rope in really large quantities locally. Sure maybe a Lunavator made of basalt cable would need to be much larger than one made of more ideal materials, but if it can be made of basalt, i like the idea anyhow. Not only would it mean you don't have to spend payload space on an awful lot of cable, it means you can do continuous maintenance on the complex using your own resources. The tether tip velocity to pick up a payload is 0.75 km/s, much better than the 1.68 km/s tether tip velocity needed for a &lt;a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~geoffrey.landis/Lunar_Sling_Launcher.pdf"&gt;sling launcher&lt;/a&gt; to put something in lunar orbit. If a payload is released at that speed, then it has to add on the 0.93 km/s it needs to stay in orbit before it hits the ground. But it has a fair bit of time to do that, meaning big crude rocket engines made on the Moon would be good enough. This gives the Moon a way to ease in to both tether manufacture and rocket manufacture. I even pondered the idea of giant liquid-oxygen-based &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistojet_rocket"&gt;resistojets&lt;/a&gt; as a way for lunar robots to build rocket motors that are good enough to get the job done, albeit inefficient and crude. Otherwise known as simple and reliable. Or maybe more conventional engines from Earth could be made beefy enough, with such a light workload, to work for several hundreds of trips. They could fly back to the Lunavator to be captured, set down on the surface, and reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Lunavator tether is thickened and reinforced, and experience is gained, it can start hefting payloads at full lunar orbital velocity, or at lunar escape velocity. It can start doing this with small payloads and work up to larger ones. It would allow ion engines alone to be used for stuff that doesn't happen quickly, ones that stay in space and get refueled and serviced there. It is a way to launch lots of mass, which is the only way to do the really interesting things. It is the way the Moon will build its first space station, on a shoe-string budget compared to what it would cost an Earth enterprise to do it. A really nice space station that people would pay lots of money to be able to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, the Moon is an excellent example of how things change once you reach a tipping point. The Moon goes from being a money pit to a boomtown really quickly once you are able to do the right things - things that are based on known technology and well understood physics. A sense of the possible is all we need.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/1094115607872549373/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_25.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1094115607872549373'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1094115607872549373'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_25.html' title='Long range plans of all sorts '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8426910066198029829</id><published>2016-07-22T17:26:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T17:29:17.058-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Garden Space with Sky Views - Yes we can :) </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Feb 16th, 2016. An updated version of this will be posted soon.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, finally we have a reasonable design for a sunny space that uses spaced beams that are quite tall to limit radiation exposure to a livable amount even if you are hanging out there up to half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaN2fPomzhk/V5K3t6VtGwI/AAAAAAAAWK8/voXu4W0VVCsrVbt7Q2FNFWkcjxjopLX0ACK4B/s1600/2016021600473756c271a9ce711.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="148" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaN2fPomzhk/V5K3t6VtGwI/AAAAAAAAWK8/voXu4W0VVCsrVbt7Q2FNFWkcjxjopLX0ACK4B/s320/2016021600473756c271a9ce711.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, suppose the little rectangle with the rays emanating from it is you. The beams start 4 m above you for a nice sense of space. In this version, the beams represented by the grey rectangles are 6 m high by 50 cm wide. The complete analysis was done using beams 4 m high by 50 cm wide. In both cases, each beam is separated by 1 m. The orange rays shows a representative set of paths radiation that passes through your body can take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the model of Cernan's Promise, the beams will look roughly like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2P50_ixJmnI/V5K3yRWVGQI/AAAAAAAAWLE/xpb8tdHNj5YGZyE5ywwbBUwJ_Zg8tjAYgCK4B/s1600/2016021600542656c273420dd88.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="218" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2P50_ixJmnI/V5K3yRWVGQI/AAAAAAAAWLE/xpb8tdHNj5YGZyE5ywwbBUwJ_Zg8tjAYgCK4B/s320/2016021600542656c273420dd88.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dpe7VIj5d6U/V5K30bixLRI/AAAAAAAAWLM/WZOJPeMpOqALeHKr3sAf6sMsCLJjy5KgACK4B/s1600/2016021600545656c2736007bf0.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="174" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dpe7VIj5d6U/V5K30bixLRI/AAAAAAAAWLM/WZOJPeMpOqALeHKr3sAf6sMsCLJjy5KgACK4B/s320/2016021600545656c2736007bf0.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See how it works? Straight up, there is very little material blocking radiation, you get a full dose. But because the spaces that have only glass or a transparent membrane are separated by lots of tall beams, starting a short angle away there is enough material that the dose is lowered to a small amount, and when you average the two you are a fair bit better off than if there had only been a membrane. Especially when you get into the details - those beams also protect against all micrometeorites except the ones coming straight down, which is rarely what they do. And unlike if you just dug down and put a membrane, the whole volume is usable. You don't have to stay down low in order to get a low dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a map of how the doses work out. It bears a lot of contemplation. Because the energy in cosmic radiation is so incredibly high, it causes atomic nuclei to explode when struck and the bits that fly off have enough energy to cause other nuclei to explode too, and it takes a while before that process causes the original energy to be dispersed enough that you are getting net protection from the material shielding you instead of &lt;i&gt;actually getting a lot more radiation because of the atomic shrapnel flying around.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the map shows the area of a dome around a person through which the heightened doses due to an insufficient blocking thickness would pass. Those areas are in pink and red. The orange part offers some protection, and the yellow is better protection, good enough for permanent habitation. The green is as low as sea level on Earth. The area this dome examines is an angle of 60 degrees, roughly. Beyond where the mapping ceases, the protection has a fringe of yellow and then quickly turns to green for all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vbgP4QWwt5Y/V5K32NXhIiI/AAAAAAAAWLU/XhAv4c3Tsscd-OfcrRHmSUxXPuWvullAACK4B/s1600/2016021601221356c279c5360e8.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="304" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vbgP4QWwt5Y/V5K32NXhIiI/AAAAAAAAWLU/XhAv4c3Tsscd-OfcrRHmSUxXPuWvullAACK4B/s320/2016021601221356c279c5360e8.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So imagine if the tall east-west sides of the beams were covered with a mirror surface. If you stand between two and look up you see nothing but stars. The are angled just slightly so that here at the equator the sun tracks around over the long day and the beams are always parallel to its rays of light, the shadows stay minimal. The Earth would be visible much of the time between the beams. When it isn't, it is still coming in from the south end, where there is a mirror pool outside the sunken hall for that very purpose. And the north wall reflect that image from the mirror pool so it is visible from inside the tunnel where people will spend most of their time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you'd like a few numbers, here are the basic ones (and please remember the previous post - these numbers are estimates):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink - covers 556 triangles, of which a half sphere has 10,240 - radiation between 0.5 and 0.13 Sv/yr. Average taken as 1 Sv/yr, cautiously on the high side. Dose of this area with constant exposure 0.027 Sv/yr&lt;br /&gt;Red - covers 1120 - between 0.2 and 0.5 Sv/yr, average used is 0.4 Sv/yr (The unfilled triangles along the central axis are assumed to be red and counted in this number.) Dose of this area with constant exposure 0.022 Sv/yr&lt;br /&gt;Orange - 2024 tris, average of 0.13 Sv/yr. Dose of this area with constant exposure 0.013 Sv/yr&lt;br /&gt;Yellow - 964 tris, 0.07 Sv/yr. Dose of this area with constant exposure 0.003 Sv/yr&lt;br /&gt;Green - 248 tris, Earth sea level equivalent, taken as 0.01 Sv/yr. If the rest of the half sphere is all green, that is another 0.003 Sv/yr. I padded that to 0.005 Sv/yr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which gave a round number of 0.07 Sv/yr total if you were always in that space. Spend half your time there, that's 0.035 Sv/yr. The maximum allowed for nuclear plant workers is 0.05 Sv/yr. So we're good. And we can soak up some sun and see the actual sky, and have healthy growing plants. Ahhhh....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let us remember what we don't know. Humans have never spent extended periods of time exposed to galactic cosmic rays. Never. The Apollo astronauts got the biggest doses in history but weren't exposed for more than 9 or 10 days each. These rays are actually particles, and they really aren't like radiation as we know it. In fact their name is a hold-over from when we thought they were radiation because they seemed like it, but actually they are protons, neutrons, and sometimes entire atomic nuclei stripped of their electrons, whipping through space at incredibly high speeds, coming from god knows where but it isn't from around here. Probably from supernovas. Our bodies repair damage from radiation if it is a small enough amount and happens slowly enough. It would in all probability react exactly the same way to cosmic rays. So we just have to keep our exposure down to levels our body can repair as part of its normal daily routine of cleaning, patching, and sprucing up. But we need to know much more before our first buff astronauts bathe in the sun in their hammocks among the tomato plants.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8426910066198029829/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_21.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8426910066198029829'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8426910066198029829'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_21.html' title='The Garden Space with Sky Views - Yes we can :) '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZaN2fPomzhk/V5K3t6VtGwI/AAAAAAAAWK8/voXu4W0VVCsrVbt7Q2FNFWkcjxjopLX0ACK4B/s72-c/2016021600473756c271a9ce711.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-7434816463905017840</id><published>2016-07-22T17:16:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T17:16:00.174-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Radiation and windows - a cosmic ray blind design </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Feb 13th, 2016.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, i want to emphasize that how much radiation one would actually get on the surface of the Moon is UNKNOWN. I've scrounged for figures repeatedly on this, and went with numbers for initial designs that numbers from new sources make sound silly, which is why an initial dome design had such thin walls. Then i noticed the &lt;a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?2000ESASP.462..289A&amp;amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf"&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt; i'd happily started using seemed to have slipped a decimal over one spot to the left in the chart backing up all their statements, repeated in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DI41N-eC7VA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=2393"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. You can tell because the starting figure for radiation on the open surface definitely shouldn't be 0.02 Sv per year. It should be 0.2 Sv/yr. That came out when i found the &lt;a href="http://sci.esa.int/Conferences/ILC2005/Manuscripts/JablonskA-01-DOC.pdf"&gt;other reference&lt;/a&gt; the video mentions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally today i found a paper that puts it in perspective. An exceedingly relevant snippet from the abstract of Radiation exposure in the moon environment by Reitz, Berger, and Matthiae:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;On Earth, the contribution to the annual terrestrial dose of natural ionizing radiation of 2.4 mSv by cosmic radiation is about 1/6, whereas the annual exposure caused by GCR on the lunar surface is roughly 380 mSv (solar minimum) and 110 mSv (solar maximum). The analysis of worst case scenarios has indicated that SPE may lead to an exposure of about 1 Sv. The only efficient measure to reduce radiation exposure is the provision of radiation shelters.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Very recently some data were added by the Radiation Dose Monitoring (RADOM) instrument operated during the Indian Chandrayaan Mission and the Cosmic Ray Telescope (CRaTER) instrument of the NASA LRO (Lunar Reconnaisance Orbiter) mission. These measurements need to be complemented by surface measurements.*&lt;br /&gt;Models and simulations that exist describe the approximate radiation exposure in space and on the lunar surface. &lt;i&gt;The knowledge on the radiation exposure at the lunar surface is exclusively based on calculations applying radiation transport codes in combination with environmental models.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*That bit translates in my mind to "the results don't correlate and/or don't make sense, so we don't believe them".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The radiation figures cited should be considered in the light of these calculations being astonishingly complex, mainframe computers needed, and the models haven't really been checked against reality, so there is no saying how accurate they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one last bit of pause, consider how &lt;a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Eugene Parker sees it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ABazHTTDjQ/V5K1hjfhNlI/AAAAAAAAWKw/pGNhLafImcAMAcmgMW1yGbwxmWjxreDdQCK4B/s1600/2016021318185556bf738f6b2be.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="472" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ABazHTTDjQ/V5K1hjfhNlI/AAAAAAAAWKw/pGNhLafImcAMAcmgMW1yGbwxmWjxreDdQCK4B/s640/2016021318185556bf738f6b2be.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This estimate is from 2006, but its high end figure is a third of the high end in the Reitz, Berger, and Matthiae paper. It's a total non-linear, non-intuitive mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the design approach now being used does well in any of these scenarios. The part of it i'm working on now even provides a way to have a glazed roof over large portions of a sunken hall, provided you have a recessed area for when there are solar flares, and you get the proportions of the beams right. The proportions it has right now uses the average of 0.25 Sv/yr from the paper quoted above, which matches the charts from the other reference works, as long as you shift the decimal in the spots where it has drifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am posting this early, the analysis of the radiation that penetrated it isn't done, but this helped me think it through. The illustration should be ready in a few hours.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/7434816463905017840/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/radiation-and-windows-cosmic-ray-blind.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/7434816463905017840'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/7434816463905017840'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/radiation-and-windows-cosmic-ray-blind.html' title='Radiation and windows - a cosmic ray blind design '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ABazHTTDjQ/V5K1hjfhNlI/AAAAAAAAWKw/pGNhLafImcAMAcmgMW1yGbwxmWjxreDdQCK4B/s72-c/2016021318185556bf738f6b2be.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-3338377483630766802</id><published>2016-07-22T17:02:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T17:02:11.906-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Heat Islands</title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Feb 11th, 2016.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from a severe rabbit-in-headlights reaction when i open the &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/lunar_sourcebook/"&gt;Lunar Sourcebook&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, i know it is a venerable tome that contains about everything i need. But it is also extremely detailed and dense and designed for people who are trained in the field. &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/science/kring/lunar_exploration/briefings/lunar_soil_physical_properties.pdf"&gt;David Kring's Powerpoint summary&lt;/a&gt; of its information on the nature of the regolith is much more my speed. I was musing over it again this morning. It tells a tale of regolith density at depths over a meter that (once again) is not the idea i had. There are so many things to know, you see, and though i've scanned a lot of material, some things take a lot longer to register clearly than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, alright, as we can see on slide 22 of that presentation, below the first foot of regolith, relative density rises to over 90 percent. And on slide 27 we see that there it conducts heat as well as porcelain does. So forget what i said about it being a good insulator. It will suck up heat like crazy. However, we are still okay, in fact this could be regarded as a good thing - as long as you think more long term. Let us talk about heat islands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat diffuses outwards in all directions based purely on the statistical likelihood of a particle with more kinetic energy striking one with less and thus transferring some of its energy in the collision. We experience that kinetic energy of molecules as heat (well, unless a very large number of them are moving in the same way at the same time). When you pour heat energy into a medium, the heat moves away more slowly the closer the temperature of the surrounding material is to the temperature at the heat source. So the longer heat is poured into the ground around the sunken hall we are building, the slower it will move away. At night the heat closest to the hall is just as likely to move towards it as away from it. When dawn arrives, heat starts pouring in again, and at first it will sink in to the ground faster than it did at sunset, because the ground is cooler than it was then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regolith deeper than 80 cm remains at a pretty constant temperature all day and all night. That temperature is about -20 degrees Celsius (-4 Farenheit). Once you expose that layer to the heat of the sun, it will start warming up for the first time in maybe a billion years. Then at night you want to limit heat loss with reflective insulation so that heat builds up. Thus we seek a recipe in which enough sunlight pours in during the day, into the right geometry of material, to create a heat island where the temperature stays reasonably close to something pleasant all the time. And we'd like to reach that temperature within a few years, so that people can arrive to a temperate clime. To get that done we are talking about dumping in a lot of heat, but it should be possible to achieve a desirable balance in a few years with a good design and possibly a few tweaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Earth this approach to temperature control has probably best been explored as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passive-Annual-Heat-Storage-Improving/dp/0615905889?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;*Version*=1&amp;amp;*entries*=0"&gt;Passive Annual Heat Storage&lt;/a&gt;. The rule of thumb in that method is that if you thermally isolate a volume of dry soil extending 6 m from an underground home and heat it to the desired temperature, the temperature in the home will stay within a degree or two of that year-round using only the passive heat of the sun, through south-facing windows in a normal-looking house, other than that the rest of it is buried under a thick layer of soil. Beyond that 6 m point the temperature slowly falls to the annual average, which on Earth in mid-latitudes is 5 or 6 Celsius. If you look at the 'Look Inside' preview of the book at the Amazon link above, there is a case study where such a home's earthen thermal store reached a good temperature within 2 years, and was close after only a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Moon the temperature gradient we have to deal with is much steeper, -20 to 20 Celsius, 40 degrees instead of 15 or so. But the conditions for doing that are very favorable. Sun that averaged over time is twice as strong as what most places on Earth receive, the ability to control heat loss quite precisely and completely with just a few sheets of reflective foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess - and i say this with 68 arbitrary units more confidence than i've said other things - is that even the smallish sunken hall planned in Phase 1 can have a pleasant area of windows (or, you know, window-like objects) and be kept at a pleasant, even temperature using only reflective shutters. A set of them hooked up to a simple program that opens and closes them on some schedule would be enough, and at least a couple could always be open for that key view of the full Earth bounced into the hall from a mirror.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/3338377483630766802/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/heat-islands.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3338377483630766802'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/3338377483630766802'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/heat-islands.html' title='Heat Islands'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-1199299183123830649</id><published>2016-07-22T16:57:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T16:57:43.074-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Moving day </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Feb 10th, 2016.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much contemplation, Cernan's Promise will be moved today to a spot half a kilometer north of its current location. Several changes in approach go with this move. Turns out planning an entire Moon colony, even just for education and inspiration, has a steep learning curve full of false starts, half-baked ideas, and a wide variety of mistakes. As hikers learn over time where best to pitch a tent, my feel for how best to make use of what the Moon offers is slowly growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RVgtRC3hKLc/V5KxRJAiDQI/AAAAAAAAWKY/rUvqt6innfwbGSMWpiqrE9_wVXHceJwjQCK4B/s1600/2016021018045356bb7bc524762.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RVgtRC3hKLc/V5KxRJAiDQI/AAAAAAAAWKY/rUvqt6innfwbGSMWpiqrE9_wVXHceJwjQCK4B/s400/2016021018045356bb7bc524762.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now modeled this section of the rim of Lalande Crater much better, and made much better use of LRO photos to do so. I have done my best to make the boulders and outcrops shown in the photo accurate, and properly assess their scale. This is made more difficult by the fact that there exist only 2 photos of this area from LRO. In fact, to roughly estimate the downward slope heading away from the crater, i made some use of the photo taken by Apollo 16. As near as i can tell, the boulders in the foreground above are about 20 m high at their tallest, and the mound behind about 15 m at its tallest. Those 2 areas, and the large number of other boulders nearby, are the justification for the move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to store heat and energy through the night has been my main focus recently. Many recent posts discuss the matter. In my view, you want the right balance of two things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enough powder and fine-grain regolith to prevent heat from diffusing quickly, because even packed tightly such material is about half voids and it conducts heat so slowly it is decent insulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enough dense rock to store heat in vast quantities so that power use for heating at night and cooling during the day is minimal. If you have enough such rock, you need no heating or cooling at all. Just let in the right amount of sunlight during the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were boulders to be had near Teacup Crater, but this area has a true bounty. Teacup's boulder resources didn't seem adequate once i thought about it a lot. A big factor here is that the more i think about it, the more i suspect that the fine regolith layer at the rim of Lalande is very deep. Though it is mixed with a lot of boulders, it would be a mistake to assume there are enough in a particular area without evidence. Digging down to the mega-regolith layer to access superior thermal mass resources will be difficult, unless it is done through the inside wall of Lalande Crater. Though it is only a guess, i think there is sufficient evidence to postulate that the fine-grain regolith layer could be 100 m deep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The inside wall of Lalande Crater is paydirt. We want to get down in there and start digging as fast as we can. I'd already identified that collection of large boulders i have started calling Gibraltar as the place to anchor ourselves so that is easier and safer. Now i think it is important to capitalize on them that way even more than i thought before, and even sooner. The slope inside the rim here is about 40 degrees on average, and steeper in spots. Lunar regolith compacts extremely well and flows extremely poorly, but you really, really don't want your rovers to get stuck, or heaven forbid, be struck by a boulder that has started rolling downhill. Gibraltar will live up to its name by having a winch with a long strong cable bolted to it, and anchor points for further cables. Advancing deep into Lalande will require the loose rocks be cleared, a winch will come in very handy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some of those loose rocks are paydirt on their own, because chances are they are composed of purer minerals than powder regolith.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 300 m below the rim and 500 m east there is a ridge that looks very much like an outcropping of a strata of solid rock. Most likely, that is highland material extending from the hills 2 km or so to the west of the rim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The adequacy of regolith as radiations shielding is much worse than i thought. The 1.2 m of packed regolith i'd envisioned in the early dome idea would only have made human residents sick. Cosmic radiation is so powerful that atomic nuclei are smashed when hit with such a particle, creating a cascade effect that takes over 5 m of loose regolith to block. That's not blocking all the radiation, just the extra radiation due to the particle cascade. To then protect against the dose that you'd get on the open surface, you need another 2.5 m of regolith. This issue was what made me decide to dig out the habitat, however difficult that is, because the lenses really help with that and it is by far the safest thing. The deeper you can dig the better, because the smaller the portion of sky you see, the less radiation you get. The closer to the rim of Lalande you can dig, the better, because then you can tunnel to it - an excellent place to expand the colony.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tpLcpYt0wok/V5KxVHI9MII/AAAAAAAAWKg/1-eTb_RJ7ZErVvP6hYfys1n0Q0TSoP3LgCK4B/s1600/2016021020465956bba1c3dbaa2.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="183" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tpLcpYt0wok/V5KxVHI9MII/AAAAAAAAWKg/1-eTb_RJ7ZErVvP6hYfys1n0Q0TSoP3LgCK4B/s400/2016021020465956bba1c3dbaa2.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/1199299183123830649/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/moving-day.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1199299183123830649'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1199299183123830649'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/moving-day.html' title='Moving day '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RVgtRC3hKLc/V5KxRJAiDQI/AAAAAAAAWKY/rUvqt6innfwbGSMWpiqrE9_wVXHceJwjQCK4B/s72-c/2016021018045356bb7bc524762.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-6590413929436619218</id><published>2016-07-22T16:47:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T16:47:04.540-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Far out proposal </title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="tr_bq"&gt;(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project.

(not exactly as we must compensate for radiation pressure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is a 4.9 MW flash light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would of course be tilted 45 degrees at dusk and dawn, so that reduce the power to 3.5 MW, and also, pointing the beam directly at the base is a challenge. Was 300W/m² what the plants needed? Well, then it is enough for a 12000 m² garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know Moonwards is not intended to be a sci-fi setting, and the main focus is keeping things as realistic as possible, but I just had to say it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My reply:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey, if it works technically, it deserves to be examined and depicted on the site. I have heard a bit about such ideas, but never looked for articles about it because i had the idea it would be for farther in the future. Of course i hope that Moonwards will grow into a 3d world depicting a variety of lunar bases at various points in the future. It's just that i began with a point and a set of installations that seemed like they should be done first, based on my limited knowledge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I was concerned about the aiming, like you mention. I also wondered about how flat the reflectors would need to be to get the majority of the light to fall neatly on the base. If those can be managed, then absolutely it should be modeled and included. Here you have a big advantage over me until i set aside modelling, writing, and coding the website to learn a lot more math and physics. If you can establish what the parameters should be and sketch out a design, i'll make the model. Or help you make the model if you wish, or something like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There has to be a few papers out there on this concept. I can't think of how one might search for them. Maybe ask in the Pod Bay, TildalWave might have an idea. A couple of simple searches on NTRS didn't yield anything. A search for 'reflector earth moon' (couldn't think of better) yielded &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/12/science/russians-to-test-space-mirror-as-giant-night-light-for-earth.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;Russians to Test Space Mirror as Giant Night Light for Earth&lt;/a&gt;, from the New York Times, 1993. Surprisingly close for such a simple search, actually.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There are of course other reasons to create an installation at the EML1 point, so such a system there could be refined and expanded over time. Again, the challenge is to get things going, but if Moonwards catches on and we have the resources, modelling such a station would be a good project. My sense right now is that once Cernan's Promise is basically set up - it will constantly be expanded, but once all its principal installations have a decent model - then it is time to model a polar base, and an EML1 station.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Also, in my mission to goad people into taking space more seriously, i of course did the half-baked calculation in &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/forum/index.php?id=41"&gt;this post,&lt;/a&gt; in which i mused how much area of mirror would be needed on the Moon to cause chaos on Earth. Perhaps you would like to play with that idea for your EML1 installation too. After all, if we propose mirrors in space big enough to light lunar crops overnight to feed the lunar populace, what might those do if they were turned towards the Earth and focused on a much tighter area? :]]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/6590413929436619218/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/far-out-proposal.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6590413929436619218'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6590413929436619218'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/far-out-proposal.html' title='Far out proposal '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8437555705042301144</id><published>2016-07-22T16:34:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T16:34:47.645-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Lighting a Garden </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is a set if posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project.

Some posts in the thread that were unrelated have been omitted.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i was looking into the power needs to light a garden through the night enough to keep the plants healthy. And i went to the NASA Technical Reports Server looking for papers on the topic. And sure enough, there were a number, going back decades. But they used odd specialized units for power - PAR, Photosynthetically Active Radiation, was measured in μmol/m2*s, being the number of photons received by each meter each second. They didn't actually say how many watts the lights were drawing. But after a while i found a paper that stated that. That paper was using BloomBoss UFO LED Growlights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wu-qqGTB30U/V5KmZDsmPBI/AAAAAAAAWKA/2ihba76NEmA7ls9BVfjhPqj8ghuG2M3PwCK4B/s1600/2016020516491056b4d286d7f5c.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wu-qqGTB30U/V5KmZDsmPBI/AAAAAAAAWKA/2ihba76NEmA7ls9BVfjhPqj8ghuG2M3PwCK4B/s320/2016020516491056b4d286d7f5c.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At which point i did a facepalm. Of course. What was i thinking, not going to the small marijuana grow-op scene for detailed and accurate information on how to grow plants in artificial light. And a wide range of products designed for exactly that. That NASA researcher was a practical guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lcZ-2g-IwLQ/V5Kmb8VFLcI/AAAAAAAAWKI/MFxFARxlzIEqDl-HDByTdUGuSxjgTXYgQCK4B/s1600/2016020517173856b4d932f2ae6.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="167" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lcZ-2g-IwLQ/V5Kmb8VFLcI/AAAAAAAAWKI/MFxFARxlzIEqDl-HDByTdUGuSxjgTXYgQCK4B/s400/2016020517173856b4d932f2ae6.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he actually has dreadlocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the light unit above is conveniently designed to illuminate 9 square feet for 90 W, so that's 10 W per ft2, for easy scaling calculations for your... indoor garden. At 11 ft2 per m2, that's 11000 ft2 for the 1000 m2 garden i'd proposed, and thus 110 kW to illuminate the garden - if it was all illuminated at the same time. If it is divided into 2 halves and each is illuminated 12 hours a day, that is 55 kW, or 36 kW if divided in thirds and illuminated for 8 hours. What a deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper referenced illuminated its plants 18 hours a day for some reason. Given that half the time the garden will be illuminated by good old sunlight, i bet 8 hours is fine. Now, to get these results, the lights were no more than 24 inches from the leaves (60 cm). To have an interesting garden with plants of many different heights, including bushes and trees, it would probably be best to put the lights on strings and carefully weave them among the plants. The distribution of the different LEDs would need to be precise to get the best results. The format is 8 red LEDS plus a blue LED. Overall the effect is of pink light - quite relaxing. A reflective tent of&lt;br /&gt;reinforced mylar will need to be extended over the whole garden when night falls to keep the light where it can do its work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a garden is going to be rather easier than i'd feared. You do need the nuclear power plant to make it possible in the early days, but we already knew that makes a ton of sense. Once you bring a couple of payloads of water from the poles, and have the first sunken hall completely pressurized and balanced at a comfortable temperature, you can start right in on it. Once growing nicely, this garden would greatly reduce the payload mass of food needed from Earth (pro tip - eat bugs!) and be a great boon to the hall's ambiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reply from Robert Walker:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Right, I got a similar figure for my article about astronauts getting all their oxygen from growing food. 20 watts to illuminate 0.2 square meters for a modern high efficiency LED grow light. It's the LEDs that reduce the power requirements so much compared with earlier experiments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At the same time - if they grow all their own food, then they also automatically must produce all their own oxygen too. Because we turn nearly all the oxygen in the food into the CO2 that we exhale. Feces are just a tiny part of the total mass there, especially once you remove the water from them, most of the mass of our food is either exhaled as CO2 or its water, far easier to recycle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;So to complete the cycle, if we grow plants and they take up the CO2 that we exhale, they must also automatically produce enough oxygen for us to breath in to turn the food back into CO2 again next time we harvest it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only 50% of the plant mass is used as food, but that doesn't matter. Even with burning up all the plant wastes, the excess oxygen after taking account of that still must exactly balance the amount of oxygenthe astronauts need to breath to eat the food.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Also the amount of growing area needed is far less than most would realize. If you use hydroponics and rapidly growing crops, then you can grow nearly all the food from a tiny area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;With the BIOS-3 experiments, it was 13 square meters per person, for 78% of their dry food requirements and nearly all their oxygen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;See my article here for more details and links to some of the research:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.science20.com/robert_inventor/could_astronauts_get_all_their_oxygen_from_algae_or_plants_and_their_food_also-156990"&gt;Could Astronauts Get All Their Oxygen From Algae Or Plants? And Their Food Also?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Alright, now i've read the article properly, and i have a few thoughts. There is a lot of useful information and i imagine i'll need to review the article once a garden space is being designed. And a few of the linked articles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me, even the first sunken hall and it's garden space (which i've started calling a dugout) have to look great, like a place a person would definitely want to be. First, this is to draw people to spend time in the Virtual Colony once complete, but also i think this would be well worth any extra money spent in a real colony. So i'd put the algae in an aquarium type of construction, a tall narrow aquarium in which the swirling spirulina are seen in mottled shades of fresh green, as a pump swirls them around and sun filters through the tank. Water should be pretty cheap for the colony as long as there is no problem with the shuttles or the polar water mine. Using extra for something like this isn't too extravagant. And i often think about what it would be like to be in the dugout. I think such a tank would be quite pretty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I make fermented drinks from organic fruit juice and sugar here at home. It has proven to be an important element of my diet, as i have health issues that can become much worse if i don't eat properly. And after all, before soda was made commercially, people made drinks like this all the time. It's very simple. My drinks are often just as fizzy as pop, and it's all CO2. I don't let them ferment long enough to have a significant alcohol content, but they are still quite fizzy. Of course, residents might well like the idea of home-brewing beer. Maybe that wouldn't make much difference to the oxygen - CO2 budget, but it is another possible pathway. Anything sweet can be used for this, including some plant waste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having eaten spirulina, i can tell you its flavor is okay, but i wouldn't want to eat it in large quantities. And it is not the kind of flavor you can easily combine with other things, or disguise. If a good portion of it could be used for other things besides eating, that would be preferable. It would be more tolerable in a diet together with the other plants you listed, like dwarf wheat, mixed greens, and potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surely it would be easy to add a few insects to this system early on too. I have had grasshoppers, they aren't bad. Meal worms apparently have a nice nutty flavor, and you can avoid the ick factor by drying them and grinding them into a flour. I wonder how they would affect the oxygen / carbon dioxide budget.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dugout is big, 30 x 60 m at the top, narrowing to 10 x 60 m at the bottom. I strongly feel building big is very important to success, and that the robotic technique based so much on melting basalt with sunlight makes that entirely feasible. So there is lots of space for a variety of plants. I quite agree the thing is to use some system to grow plants in a number of layers to best use space. I would really like to come up with a design that is effective and also attractive, which conveyor belts don't bring to mind at all. Maybe some system of trays rotating around an axis. There should be enough room to spare for this to work, and it would be much more attractive, i think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's all i can think of for now. Thanks for giving me a lot of ideas and a sound basis to start from. If you have input as to how to design the gardens, please hold forth!&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8437555705042301144/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/lighting-garden.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8437555705042301144'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8437555705042301144'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/lighting-garden.html' title='Lighting a Garden '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wu-qqGTB30U/V5KmZDsmPBI/AAAAAAAAWKA/2ihba76NEmA7ls9BVfjhPqj8ghuG2M3PwCK4B/s72-c/2016020516491056b4d286d7f5c.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-2827629469189480791</id><published>2016-07-22T14:41:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T16:02:16.656-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Good links and resources </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Feb 3rd, 2016.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finally going to list a few of the things i've encountered lately:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://integratedspaceanalytics.com/cms/"&gt;Integrated Space Plan &lt;/a&gt;- One big graphic documenting all space projects and plans and how they fit into the long-term goal of colonizing the solar system. All the entries are linked to an information page on that topic, which contain further links to many resources specific to that. (I have thought about doing graphics like this myself and this is a great example.) Fav link: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrTnVjsR12s"&gt;A real lunar crane design from NASA Langley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://highfrontier.com/"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://highfrontier.com/"&gt;High Frontier game&lt;/a&gt; - I got an email from the developers of this a while ago. It is a game about solar system colonization that is realistic and educational. I hadn't looked at it in a while and it is coming along nicely. It isn't a collaborative framework like Moonwards is trying to be, and the game is goal-oriented in a way i'm not interested in for the interactive content i hope will later be part of Moonwards. It serves a different purpose, and seems on track to do so well. This is&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoTu6HEao6E"&gt; the demo video &lt;/a&gt;linked to in that email, which i enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061206083416/http://aerospacescholars.jsc.nasa.gov/HAS/cirr/em/6/6.cfm"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061206083416/http://aerospacescholars.jsc.nasa.gov/HAS/cirr/em/6/6.cfm"&gt;Mining and Manufacturing on the Moon&lt;/a&gt; - now only available on the Wayback Machine. Shucks. It has a bunch of great little nuggets in it, presented in a digestible overview format. Some of the links are broken, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20060013652.pdf"&gt;Lunar In Situ Materials-Based Surface Structure Technology Development Efforts at NASAMSFC&lt;/a&gt; - a ton of experimentation with possible construction techniques has been done at Marshall SFC over the years, and this is a great summary. Favorite line: 'several hundred meters of 0.010-in. to 0.030-in. diameter glass fiber, shown in Figure 10, have been successfully&lt;br /&gt;pulled from a bath of molten JSC-I, demonstrating the ability to manufacture glass fibers.'&lt;br /&gt;So that is some good stuff. I find it hard for my head to not start spinning when i get into research. In no time i have 20 tabs and a dozen documents open, and a week later i can't find half of them again. I'm really trying more now to file important links and docs for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunar crane pic from the video above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SmMOWCgbmJQ/V5KldG1CdvI/AAAAAAAAWJ0/JIs-sWE8khg7XQZXacD3X2fg8YNcXZs6QCK4B/s1600/2016020319011356b24e7965411.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="292" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SmMOWCgbmJQ/V5KldG1CdvI/AAAAAAAAWJ0/JIs-sWE8khg7XQZXacD3X2fg8YNcXZs6QCK4B/s320/2016020319011356b24e7965411.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/2827629469189480791/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/good-links-and-resources.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2827629469189480791'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/2827629469189480791'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/good-links-and-resources.html' title='Good links and resources '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SmMOWCgbmJQ/V5KldG1CdvI/AAAAAAAAWJ0/JIs-sWE8khg7XQZXacD3X2fg8YNcXZs6QCK4B/s72-c/2016020319011356b24e7965411.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-4879431221963525867</id><published>2016-07-22T14:41:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T15:06:19.184-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Energy storage as heat </title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="tr_bq"&gt;(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Feb 2nd, 2016.)  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 new images today on the main page. The solar furnace has been updated to something i am finally happy with, at least at this stage of concept development. The dome has been completely chucked out in favor of an even larger sunken gallery. Right now the model is only a hole in the ground, but i have big plans and will work on that model this week. Also in the text for the numbers i mention the crane is about to be replaced with a model on rails. Let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After mulling a bit the scale necessary to store energy for overnight use with the Potential Energy Storage System i'd very roughly postulated, it seems like something that would take a long time to develop to the point where it could play a significant role. I could be wrong about that as i am still a long way from taking the time to learn calculus the way i want to - i have to stick to working on the website and its content - and so the needed calculations are beyond me. And maybe the proper approach simply hasn't occurred to me. Maybe lowering absolutely gigantic weights very slowly on really sturdy rails would make the task more manageable. Meaning i also have to learn a lot of physics... At any rate i am indebted to Sigvart for giving me a better handle on the scale involved here. So now i'm all keen on storing heat energy that steam turbines can tap day and night for a smoother energy supply that requires less construction. Well, at least i think it would... The first missions would still rely on nuclear power, the cost and mass of a few plants sufficient to power the early days has no competition, they win hands down. But getting to the point where such plants can be built on the Moon, or even fueled on the Moon, is a complicated endeavor. So something is needed to bridge the gap between when more nuclear plants to power the growing colony is too expensive, and when the colony is capable of producing such plants itself. An alternative to nuclear has also got to be a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core of everything proposed so far is that the strong constant sunlight on the Moon is the best power source for everything, and figuring out how to use it directly to make stuff and do stuff is the best way to go. So let me lean on that again. What if a gigantic tank of fused magnesia was filled with regolith (and enough of a gas to facilitate heat transmission through it, because without it regolith has really low thermal conductivity). And what if there was a whole network of pipes through that tank - iron ones i guess, it is the easiest metal to purify from the regolith by far. And those pipes carried a working fluid, i guess some salt that stays liquid through the appropriate temperature range, it would be nice if that could come all from the Moon but probably it would need to be imported. Then you make a nice long mirrored parabolic trough and send a set of those pipes down its focal point and back to the giant tank, heating up that regolith nice and hot, over 1000 degrees C maybe. On the other side of the tank you have a series of steam-driven turbines. They have their own circuits through the tank, in which water turns to steam, comes back, turns the turbines, and then goes to radiators to lower their temperature low enough to condense to water, and thence get circulated back into the hot tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pluses i see in this is that as long as the main heat mass, the giant hot tank, was kept above 100 degrees C, your steam turbines could run all the time. They run at lower power output at the lower temperatures at the end of the long cold night and perhaps with a hit on efficiency due to having to operate over a wide range of temperatures and heat gradients, but they run. And maybe the power density you can expect in this concept is good. The vacuum works in your favor, slowing heat loss so thatmuch more of it can be directed to the turbines than if such a system was used on Earth. Just envelope the main tank in many reflective layers, same as there is on the tanks connect to the solar furnace, and suspend it above the ground on legs as small as possible while still structurally sound. The vast majority of this system can be fabricated right on the Moon without a lot of infrastructure. There needs to be a way of purifying magnesia to make the tank out of a material that can handle the temperature range. A way to do that has to be found for other reasons too, because there is certainly plenty of magnesia to be had and it would be very useful. I think maybe heating regolith to well over the temperature at which crystals start to form in it, and whipping it around in a centrifuge to separate it into its constituent layers might be enough, but i don't know. The molten salt needs to be imported, seems to me the rest can be 3d printed or cast from materials not that hard to get on the Moon at an early stage of industrial development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scale? Beats me. The big, big thing about this is that over the night all plants will die if they don't have a light source at least a few hours a day that is pretty intense. Energy can be saved on that by narrowing the light frequency to the bands most useful to plants. I have to go check numbers on that, but let me guesstimate again, for now (cuz it's getting late and i have to do stuff and want to post this before tomorrow, later i can make improvements. Shall we say 300 W/m2 for say 6 hours out of every 24 for good health? That seems pretty reasonable, it could maybe be cut down a lot more if you are just giving them enough to get them through the night and you choose the right plants and the right wavelengths of light. Let's go even with 500 W/m2 to account for inefficiency in the lights and so on. For a garden of 1000 m2 that you light in patches for 6 hours each, rotating through them all night long, you need 125 kW of power, all the time, just for that. So how big a system would be needed for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any takers on that calculation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - initially this was going to be about why i decided to put the crane on rails. One reason is that this system is long and the crane would be useful in building it. But there are other things planned for that crane. I'll get to that tomorrow. The sunken gallery will be extended with it too (probably saw that one coming though). And there was other stuff - scaling up the MIPs, and installing other infrastructure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reply from Sigvart Brendberg:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;That is brilliant Kim!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Any takers on that calculation?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, we need to establish the energy storage needed. For a power consumption of over 150 KW, we need about 200 GJ of storage. I am going to use that number for reference for future calculation, if there are no dramatic changes in the required power supply. This is for a up-and-running base, and of course it has lot smaller requirements in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The energy efficiency of converting the stored heat into electricity is not that great, about 10%. We therefore need about 2 TJ of storage. At a temperature difference of a 1000 degrees, we obtain a bit less than 300 tons of rock, at a specific heat capacity of 700 J/kg*K (basalt-ish). This number is scalable, in case you want another temperature. (For instance 600 tons for a temperature difference of 500 degrees).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is quite a bit, but regolith is (literary!) cheap as dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to need radiators! A heat source is not enough to produce energy, you need a temperature difference. For complicated calculus reasons the optimal operational temperature for the radiators is 64/81 of the temperature of the heat source. Or, it is optimal for radiator mass at least, you have a better energy efficiency with larger radiators and a lower temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are interested, a realistic energy efficiency of the conversion is given by the endoreversible heat engine efficiency: n = 1 - sqrt(Tc/Th) , where Th is the temperature inside the regolith heat storage system, and tc is the temperature of the radiators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a typical trade-off situation, determined by how much of the radiators that can be manufactured locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storage efficiency is more complicated, so I am going to do the numbers later. Seems like it follows the square-cube law, so the heat loss decreases with size.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ah yes, radiators. I mentioned them briefly but didn't give them much thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, metals production. Some amount of iron production can be had simply by passing big magnets through a large enough quantity of regolith, especially if it is of the right kind. One of the advantages of Lalande Crater is that any type of regolith you wish should be available close by. Otherwise, molten metal oxide electrolysis, which would produce puddles of whatever metals are present in the regolith feedstock as it split the oxygen off oxide molecules. Choosing the right feedstock would mean the resulting alloy could be mostly iron and titanium, from ilmenite. That sounds pretty good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My understanding is that what you want is to make the radiators as light as possible, so they heat quickly and that way they radiate heat faster. Perhaps the approach would be to roll out the hot iron or iron/titanium alloy into sheets as thin as possible, and then have a 3d printer that uses a metal powder feed sinter a network of pipes onto that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In early days you can just import them, they are pretty light and last a long time. Probably better to go with a design that can be repaired, even if they are less efficient. Space is one thing there is no lack of. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response from Sigvart:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;An attempt to sum up the findings so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the major problems with a lunar base is the energy storage during the 14 days long lunar night. Two of the proposed solutions to this problem is the Potential Energy Storage System (PESS) and the Thermal Energy Storage System (TESS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the PESS has one unique feature; No energy loss during storage. Rocks just hang there, without radiating away or anything. Any loss is during the transformation to and from electric energy. Overall efficiency is about 50% but may be considerably different from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting aspect is the storage efficiency of 0.5 kWh per ton per 100 m (compensated for energy losses). Even if we have a short distance with a massive weight, or a long distance with a modest weight, the required cable mass Is going to be the same. The properties of the basalt ropes would be really interesting in that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing about the PESS Is that it requires high grade energy in order to fill the energy reservoir. Electricity and electric motors seems the most likely option, although a direct mechanical transfer is possible to imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TESS is a much more dynamical system, with almost no linear properties. The main advantage of the TESS is perhaps the low grade energy it requires, heat. At a work-in-progress efficiency rating of 10%, heating the reservoir with solar power gives about the same gain as solar cells, but only requiring mirrors. Another important option is that you can simply add a nuclear reactor to the system, making an efficient way of storing the power from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;High temperature end energy loss:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The storage stack, design whatsoever, is going to lose heat through two major processes. One is, if parts of its surface are adjacent to vacuum, black body radiation, governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, radiating energy proportional to the forth power of the absolute surface temperature. The other process is conduction through the walls of the storage stack, into the surrounding medium. This increases linearly with temperature. (Well, not really linearly, that is if the regolith instantly conducts the heat away, which is not going to happen. The surroundings are going to heat up, cancelling some of the temperature gradient. The actual mechanics are complicated, and strongly dependent on the exact design).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That means that the core temperature is going to increase during the charging, until it reaches a point where the heat source (mirrors, reactors) has an equal production as the heat loss from the stack. The TESS is now “topping off”. During this scenario, it is more efficient to cap the temperature a little lower (because it essentially loses the same amount of energy as it receives), and instead let the turbines run. The energy produced can be used to charge a long term system, like the PESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low temperature end energy loss:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system must have a temperature gradient in order to produce energy. That means that one end of it must remain relatively cool. Cooling is provided either by radiators, or by pipelines in the regolith. In that later case, the surrounding material would heat up with a too high energy consumption, reducing the overall efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficiency at different high-end temperatures, low-end temperature fixed to 300 degrees Kelvin. Efficiency along the y-axis, temperature in Kelvin along the x-axis:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5iD5BUY79PU/V5KVBgiZAWI/AAAAAAAAWJc/iFmg3sW6aysdLTmMMzMN6YYSlMI5a1YRQCK4B/s1600/2016020807284356b843ab3b8e4.png" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="204" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5iD5BUY79PU/V5KVBgiZAWI/AAAAAAAAWJc/iFmg3sW6aysdLTmMMzMN6YYSlMI5a1YRQCK4B/s320/2016020807284356b843ab3b8e4.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature of both extremes during normal operation is going to look something like this.

Thanks, Sigvart - kim))&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot worth pondering here. For brevity and clarity, i'm going to put my thoughts in bullet points and lists&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weight fabrication:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The longer the vertical drop, the more energy can be gotten from the same mass. As i can't think of a way to make weights that don't require a lot of fabrication, that seems important.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even if i could, at a bulk density of 1.6 g/cm3 with no wasted space, it takes a hectare of weights 10 m high to store the equivalent of 100 kW of continuous energy for 1 lunar night. Getting those weights to and from the line to be lowered and raised quickly becomes a challenge. If weights could be made mostly of solid ilmenite the same volume would store close to 300 kW all night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have a lot of cable anxiety. That is partly why i proposed the chain design in this post. The connection between links can be improved to have a much higher cross-sectional area, they fold together for storage with virtually no wasted space, and need very little extra infrastructure to get them to and from the line.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct mechanical energy in PESS: I had thought about spring-loading the stack of weights in storage in that chain-link design, to save a little on the energy involved in transferring them from storage to their monthly descent and ascent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Integrating the nuclear reactors: Oh hey, yeah! They have to be hooked up to steam turbines anyhow. Dear god, i never accounted for that in mass of the nuclear power plant. Doh! When it is time to make 3d models of these systems, i'll need to make a very basic model of it for review by others so people can adjust things easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Configuration of Hot Tank:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm thinking cube shapes for the tanks. It has a higher surface area to volume ratio than spheres or cylinders, but as the system expands, new cubical tanks could be added on the walls of the first, best limiting the surface area of the whole set of tanks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I wonder how much reflective insulation can help with radiative heat loss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To limit the contact area between the hot tanks and the ground, they need to be on posts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basalt starts to melt at around 1300 K, and is completely melted at around 1750 K. The phase changes through that temperature range must affect efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This probably doesn't help much with being specific about efficiencies, but i thought it was worth mentioning as general design principles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low temperature energy loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't understand the point about using subterranean rock as a cooling medium draining too much energy. I do know that thermodynamics is extremely complicated and can just accept that, since i can't do the calculations myself and it may be quite hard to explain. If there is any need for nighttime heating, that would still be a valuable option. I have tried a little to look into how to fabricate radiators on the Moon, but i get stuck. There are too many factors i know nothing about. 3d metal sintering doesn't convince me though, unless there is a way to create metal powder. Getting the metal? I'm comfortable with that. Making metal powder? I have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response from Sigvart:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;OK, using your specifications, I have done a crude size estimate of the storage cube. It turns out that the "^4" in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation is much more important than the loss of efficiency at a lower temperature gradient.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initial approach:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 150 kW of power during the lunar night, we need 200 GJ of storage. At ~30% conversion efficiency of the thermal system, we need 670 GJ of energy storage. For safety margins, and for the fact that we can not drain the tank down to 0 K, I call that 1 TJ for an estimate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The specific heat capacity of basalt is 840 J/kg K. That means 750 tons of basalt is required for 800 K storage. The basalt densities vary a bit, but I call it 2 tons/m³.&lt;br /&gt;That becomes a 9x9x9 cube.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;As the cube stands on posts I assume a total surface area of close to 500 m².&lt;br /&gt;The radiation numbers are not pretty. The cube is in the beginning radiating heat away at over 10 MW.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;After optimization:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a high end temperature optimization, the over all efficiency is best at 430 without any insulation. Still, it radiates away 3.6 MW at the beginning of the night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, aluminium foil can do miracles. A reflective layer of it a few cm away from the cube reflects 92% of the radiation back. 8% is absorbed, and half of that is re-emitted back to the storage cube. Heat loss at sunset down to 150 kW.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Adding one more layer of foil outside that again means halving the heat loss. However, that is going to be much better if the inner layer has a black coating on the outside. We are then down to 20 kW (the leak is of course also decreasing with the temperature, so it drops during the lunar night). That should be acceptable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Conclusion: The storage cube is about 18x18x18 metres, and has a starting temperature of about 450 K (180 degrees C) at sunset.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/4879431221963525867/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/energy-storage-as-heat.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4879431221963525867'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4879431221963525867'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/energy-storage-as-heat.html' title='Energy storage as heat '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5iD5BUY79PU/V5KVBgiZAWI/AAAAAAAAWJc/iFmg3sW6aysdLTmMMzMN6YYSlMI5a1YRQCK4B/s72-c/2016020807284356b843ab3b8e4.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-5607398284453488792</id><published>2016-07-22T14:37:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T14:37:20.937-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Got my fresnel lenses, let the melting begin! </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com &lt;/a&gt;forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project.

It was originally posted there on Jan 7th, 2016.)   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking to Doug Plata of LunarCOTS the other day, and he pointed out how big a dome made of an inflatable membrane with regolith piled over it could be, for a small payload mass. Well, true. This has motivated me to get on the job of replacing the dome design i have now with another one i was going to leave until later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having thought over the matter of basalt melted in place or poured into voids created in a prepared surface of regolith fines, i think even for the first dome the fabric can be left out, and the whole thing be made of fused basalt and packed regolith. Saves quite a bit of payload mass, and now that i really think about it, it seems entirely doable. So, let's say you sift and tamp powder regolith, and press voids into it using shapes for two different lengths of plank and one hexagonal shape. It would be a bit like the candy-making process in the picture, but with lava, on the Moon, with robots. So much more fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aDvYCw7-imU/V5KP_55rRtI/AAAAAAAAWIw/fc0oW8z9ZtMcingjkdV580iNoU6SYL6AQCK4B/s1600/how-to-make-gummy-alphabet-letters.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aDvYCw7-imU/V5KP_55rRtI/AAAAAAAAWIw/fc0oW8z9ZtMcingjkdV580iNoU6SYL6AQCK4B/s320/how-to-make-gummy-alphabet-letters.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then let's say you start assembling those planks into triangles, connecting them to the hexagons with slight angles so they start forming a geodesic dome. One of the nice things about that is that you can start in the middle and work outwards, propping up the outer edge to add each new row of planks and hubs. the dome armature made of these planks and hubs is light and easily shifted, and surprisingly sturdy, like the 2nd picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NIlhMy36kec/V5KQCycMvRI/AAAAAAAAWI4/ug5a9uCSZ2gnpVYk64FZKa50ewjTw6dEwCK4B/s1600/16_3v.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="269" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NIlhMy36kec/V5KQCycMvRI/AAAAAAAAWI4/ug5a9uCSZ2gnpVYk64FZKa50ewjTw6dEwCK4B/s320/16_3v.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn't take more than connecting the planks in the right position with little gobs of lava, just to tack it in place, and then thickening that join with more lava once it is well aligned. The hubs and planks have to be massive enough to not warp when the lava for joining is added. When you have your full dome framed in, you cover over the triangles with triangular basalt tiles and start building up a thickness of spattered lava over all of it. You end up with the same solid basalt shell of the trough design, without using any fabric and without needing specialized machinery that does nothing but build it. Then you start a second shell, this time from the bottom. build a circle a couple of meters away from the inner shell out of planks, pack it with regolith. Connect it to the inner shell in a few spots with rods to keep it rigid. Build up layers like that, of planks that hold in packed regolith, and eventually you have a solid outer shell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process is pretty tolerant of little screw-ups, and can go up fast if you have a good steady supply of lava, which is easily done with light durable equipment that uses virtually no power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been messing a lot with getting layouts well organized, and adding a lot of very preliminary material to try to give a sense of the overall direction of the project. I'm going to enjoy spending some time on models again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let's see. I'm going to say 50 m span instead of 40, and move the crane to one side instead of in the middle, and figure out how to better use the payload saved. I think this may well mean the dome frame is done on the first mission. It doesn't need a crane, and it sure would be an impressive site.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/6303750590097374498/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/no-wait-lets-change-whole-dome.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6303750590097374498'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6303750590097374498'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/no-wait-lets-change-whole-dome.html' title='No, wait... let&apos;s change the whole dome '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aDvYCw7-imU/V5KP_55rRtI/AAAAAAAAWIw/fc0oW8z9ZtMcingjkdV580iNoU6SYL6AQCK4B/s72-c/how-to-make-gummy-alphabet-letters.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-9116137839497397072</id><published>2016-07-22T14:25:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T14:25:15.972-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Lalande topographical map with LOLA data </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project.

It was originally posted there on Dec 13th, 2015.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's say you have enough infrastructure on the Moon to fabricate really good mirrors, small motors, and pivoting joints in bulk. And you make 10 km2 of mirrors and set them up outside so you can very accurately point them. That's 12 GW of sunlight to throw around, accounting for some inefficiency in the mirrors - if your target is at a small angle to the sun from the mirror's position. At a 90 degree angle it would only be 8.5 GW. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first thought of this idea of reflecting the sun from the Moon as a playful thought experiment in how a permanent human presence on the Moon changes our capabilities. I suggested a more modest 2 km2 of mirrors aimed all in the same direction would create a small star on the Moon's surface visible with the naked eye on Earth, if the mirrors were given modest tracking capabilities. A Moonstar, a little beacon of hope and wonder. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let's put on the black hat. If you focused the sunlight of all those mirrors on an area of say 10 m2... what would happen? Given that means you have to make those mirrors super flat, and put motors and pivots on a million units capable of extremely precise positioning and tracking. Or wait, do you? If you manage to focus 10 km2 on an area of Earth that's 1 km2, that's still enough to do royally nasty things. All life caught outside would die in minutes. Those sheltering in houses and such might last a few hours huddled in basements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be 10 000 units with areas of 1000 m2, which would mean circular mirrors with a radius of 18 m. That doesn't sound so very difficult, in 1/6 gravity and no weather. The industrial capacity for something like that isn't really very much. Any development of the Moon for permanent settlement would lead to it after a decade or two. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why ponder such things? Because the easier it is to do extremely destructive things, the greater the urgency of ensuring nobody does them. And in the case of the Moon, the critical thing to realize is that there is absolutely no way to control an independent colony. They are beyond your reach, they will do what they want. The only thing you can do is ensure they are happy and healthy, and therefore averse to destroying things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the thing to realize is that means we need to start now and go big. You don't leave things that could lead to global chaos to chance, you don't put them off to see what others do. You do them together, properly, and you start now.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/4869401578793116321/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/because-surest-method-of-growing-up-is.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4869401578793116321'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4869401578793116321'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/because-surest-method-of-growing-up-is.html' title='Because the surest method of growing up is having no choice '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-325375664715836459</id><published>2016-07-22T13:36:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T14:07:37.037-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Nuclear Power </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Dec 11th, 2015.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here i had figured nuclear plants of sufficient size didn't exist and might not for a long time because people are so nervous about nukes. And then i heard about the &lt;a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applications/transport/nuclear-reactors-for-space.aspx"&gt;SAFE reactor&lt;/a&gt; today. There is a working prototype. 100 kW output in a reactor that weighs about 600 kg. Man, that is a real nice output for a nice light mass, all day and all night. I was so wrong. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know how much power the heavy-duty work will take - the stuff the crane and the digger do. So much is being done directly with solar heat, it saves a lot on the electrical power the first missions need. But there is meant to be an awful lot of digging. And the crane is huge, no matter how efficient it can be. Getting a handle on that amount would be really helpful. But it is so much easier to be comfortable when the budget i'd penciled in for 135 kW of solar panels would be enough for 700 kW of nuclear power! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I note that Joe Strout asked me why not go with nuclear - i spoke before without knowing about this option and didn't give it much consideration. Solar turbines and energy storage as lifted mass still seem better choices long term. They are simple, reliable, and robust. That can come later though. The first missions can take their time setting up the towers and cables to make that possible. Until then, nukes all the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Response by Sigvart Brendberg:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;An even more important reason to choose nuclear power for the moon-base is energy storage. Even though you can produce as much solar power as you want, for example using the parabola, the night is 14 days long. Having about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery"&gt;0.5&lt;/a&gt; MJ of storage capacity per kilogram for a secondary cell, you are going to need two and a half tons of batteries per kilowatt of power you want to spend through the night... Better then with something continuously producing electricity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PESS is actually kind of solving that problem, but the mass required is large. (750 million kg*m per kilowatt of night power). For a 1 km (vertical component only) cable, that is a mass of 750 tons per kilowatt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(kind of a related, you say thorium can be used for NTRs in the first slide, but thorium is surely not fissile material on its own? It must be turned into U-233 before it is of any use.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I totally agree on your choice of using nuclear power for the base.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers Sigvart! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;750 tons per kilowatt, huh? That does indeed sound like an awful lot. Let's see, bulk powder regolith is about 1.5 g/cm3, so that's 1.5 tons per cubic meter, so 500 cubic meters to get the 750 tons for a kW, over that 1 km drop. That's a cube 8 m on a side. Basalt is 3 g/cm3 here on Earth. I'll low-ball a bit and give fused basalt produced by one of the fresnel lens setups a bulk density of 2.5 g/cm3, that's 300 m3 for 1 kW, a cube 6.8 m on a side. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had played with the idea of making weights in bulk using the MIP beds which i think will be idle a fair bit on the first and second mission, or maybe during idle time with the rovers just scanning a linear fresnel lens (one that focuses to a line) across the open surface. I thought, melt a thin layer wait a bit for it to be almost congealed, roll it into a log. I'd figured they'd need to be big, but not that big. It would take 3 logs 3 m in diameter by 15 m long to provide that kW. Then i start thinking about the cables needed to support that over and over, given that to be worth it they'd need to have weights like that say every 10m constantly lowering, all night long, for it to be worth it. Let's say with losses a line like that could provide 25 kW of power if it was continuously loaded like that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, do you mean that while that 750 tons is turning the generator, it would be generating a kW? I guess that is a rough calculation that doesn't consider friction loss and such? And i don't know how that fits with time. How long should i consider that it supplies that kind of power, before it reaches the bottom of the line and is unloaded? If i take the lunar night as 350 hours, giving a little space at dawn and dusk to consider that the sun might be blocked for a bit by the landscape or panels might not work well at such high angles, then we're looking at 33 weights always going down the line, times 350 hours, that alone is 11,550 weights. Then there needs to be some multiplier for how long it would take for each weight to descend. Whatever that multiplier is, this deals with a lot more weights than i'd idly guesstimated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you had the weights made, certainly it could still be worth it. But god that's a lot. Stick a bunch of lenses somewhere on the face of Lalande crater, doing nothing but melting the crater face in such a way that the lava melts and puddles into masses of roughly the right size? Maybe. Maybe. It is awfully seductive for me to think about doing all kinds of things with lenses, considering how little payload they occupy and how much power they represent. 115, 000 tons of lava, give or take. Hm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay - moving on to thorium refinement. You're right of course, the thorium would need to be processed into uranium 233. A long term goal. It isn't at all for the early days. It just is interesting because of the possibility of nuclear rockets and energy independence in a robust way. But where there is thorium, there may also be uranium. The thorium is what was tracked by the Lunar Prospector probe, but there was a later Japanese analysis by Kayuga found uranium. Still either one requires considerable processing, it is a long term thing.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/325375664715836459/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/nuclear-power.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/325375664715836459'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/325375664715836459'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/nuclear-power.html' title='Nuclear Power '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-553644410215837683</id><published>2016-07-22T13:29:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T13:30:46.105-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'> New Stuff Happens </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com"&gt;Moonwards.com &lt;/a&gt;forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Dec 8th, 2015.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really revamped the main page of Moonwards over the last week. Yesterday was a big chunk of new material. However, i've been letting the forum slide for a while. I don't want to post just for the sake of it, and i have had little time what with being in a rush to get new stuff up. By the time i'm done with that, i'm sort of low on inspiration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, wonder of wonders, i come here to the forum in the morning and often see that 3 or 4 people are online. Then i feel a little guilty. So i was thinking just now, 'they know to check if there have been changes to the main page, don't they?'. And i realized... maybe not. :P &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, there have been a whole bunch of changes. There is a whole new page, which i will be working feverishly on today. It's the Planning section, in which i'm finally divvying up the project into sections and chunks that can be handed out and managed. It states design principles, priorities, specifies exactly what pieces are planned for the initial VMC, what jobs need doing, and gives a sense of a way forward. Well, maybe not so great on the last point... there are so many possibilities i find it hard not to be nebulous. But there is certainly lots to do right now, and some clear next steps, though they are clearer on the what than the how. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This evening there is a teleconference of the chapter leaders of the National Space Society. Moonwards has been designated 20 minutes in the agenda, to talk about how we are doing and what our plans are. But really, right now, except for occasional advice and encouragement, and a few people i can turn to for specific questions, it is just me. There have been a few noises lately that i need to stop worrying about setting stuff up so nice and pretty and get on the job of bringing people in and giving them something interesting to do. So i decided to treat today's meeting as a deadline. Today i get to announce - alright, i'm really actively looking for people, and i need them, so come on in and tell your friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still so much work to do on models and explanations and research and improving the site. But from now on i'm going to spend a chunk of my time each week just getting people in here, and figuring out what will get them to stay. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please go look at the Planning page. It will be updated frequently now, and will shortly be connected to a Trello account and maybe some other tools. If you see anything you'd be interested in working on, email me at kim@moonwards.com or post something here. If you think something is missing from the project that you'd like to add, that's good to, talk to me.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/553644410215837683/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/new-stuff-happens.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/553644410215837683'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/553644410215837683'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/new-stuff-happens.html' title=' New Stuff Happens '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-1905109643826311999</id><published>2016-07-22T13:27:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T13:27:29.278-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Getting to why </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Nov 7thth, 2015.)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I redid a few things around the website over the last week, and finally i got to the 'about' page. I'd just thrown something on it when i built it. (Which got republished in the NSS newsletter as an announcement of the creation of Moonwards - not what i'd planned.) I take mission statements pretty seriously. I spent hours redoing it. If you want to convince non-space-nerds that a Moon colony is anything but an extravagant luxury, you really have to nail it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;'Why' - that is the name of the page in the menu now. The summary at the top is about a page long and hits all my major points, which are also some of my major buttons. If i start to get on the subject in a conversation i can really go off. The page needs to be more than that of course. I think i'll add a resources section to it, and a sort of snippets section. After i learn the jQuery to do it the way i want or find a plug-in that fits the bill. For now it has a graphic i did for the International Lunar Decade movement, that's it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i'm trying to decide how i can rant on that page a bit in a useful way, too. People who know me know i hold the Dark Side of the Moon in reserve. If you seem open-minded, or i'm already off on a tirade, i'll explain to you how even a pretty small Moon colony of a few hundred people could conquer the entire world. (Explained here if you're interested. Pretty straight-forward, really.) If the happy argument of why Moon settlement matters doesn't work, the scary one, i figure, ought to do the trick. I have encountered disagreement on this. I don't understand that. Yes, i too feel a little skittish about trotting it out because it is just so outside the realm of anything normally discussed as realistic planning for the future. But, it could be done. That matters, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow... the disjoint between what is possible now and what we actually spend our time thinking about just seems weirder to me the more i ponder it these days. Not an issue evolution has equipped us for, sure. Maybe our smartphones will change our conditioning in time for us to give the flood of new possibilites something approaching the weight they deserve in the near future. It's high time for space settlement to come in from the cold.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/1905109643826311999/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/getting-to-why.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1905109643826311999'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1905109643826311999'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/getting-to-why.html' title='Getting to why '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8237509670201470734</id><published>2016-07-22T13:24:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T13:24:38.651-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Why this isn't being placed at the poles </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the &lt;a href="http://moonwards.com/"&gt;Moonwards.com&lt;/a&gt; forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Nov 7thth, 2015.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lunar poles are all the rage, especially the South Pole and Aitken Basin. There is now good evidence that there is a lot of water ice trapped in permanent darkness there. That ice also contains carbon monoxide and nitrogen. Those volatiles can be put to excellent use on a lunar base. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also the Peaks of Eternal Light, which don't quite live up to their utopian names, but still have daylight about 80 to 90% of the time. That makes the power supply much less of an issue and evens out temperatures. Those are pretty big advantages, so why have i placed the VMC at the equator, where the nights are long and harsh and water can only be had from Earth? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main point is the poles should be home to the second base, not the first. Getting that water and other stuff is not going to be easy at all. They are in extremely cold places, kilometers below the sunny spots where a base would be. What form they come in is far from clear, but they are probably not more than 5% of the ground material in those shadowed hollows. To collect them in significant quantities will require a lot of infrastructure. They couldn't be used to supply an inhabited base for years, while all that is built and gotten rolling. Once it is rolling, the idea is it supplies the income that justifies that - you split the water into oxygen and hydrogen and sell it as rocket fuel. I have serious doubts there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That much infrastructure could also be used to create industrial scale production of oxygen at the equator - or anywhere else for that matter, the Moon is almost half oxygen. Oxygen is most of the mass of propellant, so it is still a major advantage to future missions if they can get supplies of it in space. Also it is very far from certain that the market for propellant will spring up nicely just when you need it. Basing the economic model of a settlement on a market that doesn't exist strikes me as a bad idea. I understand the temptation, but i think it is misguided. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren't mining it for profit there is no reason to mine it at all. It is much easier and more reliable to ship the water and nitrogen you need for the early phase of human settlement from Earth. Enough for 10 or 20 people can come up on one or two rockets. As life in space gets going, you can start mining those resources when the right moment arrives, and in the meantime, you can scout and study those areas thoroughly. And you can keep scaling up your oxygen production, there at the equator, using infrastructure already created for production of building materials and pure metals and metal oxides. Then you can sell LOX, with much less up front investment, and scale production smoothly as the market develops. When you finally decide to mine the poles, it could well be mostly to get water and nitrogen for a quickly expanding colony, not to sell as propellant. Also remember that once we go poking around under the lunar surface, via lava tubes or simple mining of the bedrock, there will be surprises. One of them could be volatiles trapped in bubbles and tubes that have been sealed for millions or billions of years. If so, those deposits could be much simpler to tap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the handy near-constant sunlight? I'm not that impressed. Temperature fluctuations are not a big deal with this construction method, it gives you lots of thermal mass quickly, in the domes and galleries themselves and much more so in the thermal connections they form with mega-regolith through the foundation. We are talking about building at scale, in that situation including energy storage systems for the nights isn't that hard. I've already gone on about storage of potential energy in the form of boulders lifted and lowered, and Joe has mentioned the other options of flywheels or batteries, or just sticking to nuclear for power available all the time. The amount of extra infrastructure that involves is a good deal for what you get in exchange: basalt, KREEP, and easy access. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no basalt within 1000 km of the poles. The dome construction technique being proposed right now would still work with highland regolith, but you won't be making rope or cloth out of it. Anything that needs to be flexible has to come from Earth, which includes composites that contain fiber layers. Over the long term that really sucks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phosphorus, potassium - absolutely essential, great to have nearby, and only found in KREEP deposits, which are only in Oceanus Procellarum. Those deposits also come with concentrations of thorium, and uranium too. Long term, that means nuclear reactors for energy would be an option, and more importantly, nuclear rockets. You want to open up space? Nuclear thermal rockets without the politics sound pretty awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also evacuation from the equator is easier than from the poles. If you have people there, you really want to have the option of launching at any time. At the equator you can do that with a smaller, less expensive rocket because you can keep an upper stage in orbit and rendezvous with it within an hour or two at any time. That trick only works at the poles every two weeks. The fuel to the equator is also less, which means bigger payloads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that's why. If you say that means there is no business case for settling the Moon, well, let me come back to that.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8237509670201470734/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/why-this-isnt-being-placed-at-poles.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8237509670201470734'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8237509670201470734'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/why-this-isnt-being-placed-at-poles.html' title='Why this isn&apos;t being placed at the poles '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8474282175849089267</id><published>2016-07-22T13:15:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T13:45:50.024-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Big picture? </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Oct 27th, 2015. The first part was a post by &lt;b&gt;Joe Strout&lt;/b&gt;, of the &lt;a href="http://highfrontier.com/"&gt;High Frontier&lt;/a&gt; space colonization game, and then follows my response.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I apologize if this is explained somewhere, and I missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm very impressed with the quality of what's going on here, and fully supportive of the goal as I understand it. But I'm a little vague on exactly what that goal is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that you're designing an expandable base near Lalande crater. You also talk about making a virtual base that people can play with, I guess as a computer game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you expand on the objective &amp;amp; plan there? What will this game be like? Who will create it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, are there further objectives beyond the game? E.g., would we be advocating this lunar plan to major governments or large corporations, the way Robert Zubrin has been pushing his Mars Direct plan for many years?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I'm just looking for a little clarification as to what we're trying to do here, and how we intend to accomplish it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, - Joe &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heya Joe - i'm sorry, i didn't see this entry until just now. I've been taking it easy this week after a few months of rather intense work. Normally i keep the forum open in a tab all the time, but not this week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To some degree, i'm feeling my way forward. As i think things through, i become less sure of the best way for this to grow, and so i don't want to lay out a plan that is too specific. Many options and off-branches have occurred to me. I have this feeling that the lay of the land is about to drastically change, in the space advocacy scene. SpaceX, the Chinese, a Russia renewing its nationalist space drive, cubesats, India moving forward, talk of a venture capital fund, 3d printing, Bigelow... things are burgeoning towards a major tipping point. The options for making the case for how critical space development is, is moving almost as fast. There is a lot to think about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As i finish the basic website, which i think i have to do before i make any kind of move to involve more people formally, i am considering what the best path is. Input is of course welcome. What i'm making right now is the calling card for when i ask people with the right skills to think about contributing. That i have to do on my own. I have a plan, and it should take me a few more months. Let's say by sometime in February. What you see right now is maybe a tenth of what is in my head. I need a complete rough draft based on my own ideas, many of which will later be modified or replaced when informed input comes in, but at least it will all hang together as one integrated vision. That i think is critical so i want it to have that presence from the start. Also the layout and interactivity of the site needs a lot of work, i can do better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then? I'll seek people through the Blender community who would be interested in building more involved, complete models in exchange for having a window pop up, in the eventual 3d environment the whole thing will be in, whenever a special kind of button is pressed, which each model will have. In that window, the people who built it get to post a short write up and a few images, and put their logo and contact info. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll seek sponsors who will help convince Blender and app-programmer types that such a deal will work for them because this thing will likely get enough traffic for that to genuinely be a networking tool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll go into the NSS community very actively searching for a few people who can help put the website completely in shape to be a high-traffic site that can administer the teams involved. And also seeking NSS introductions to organizations who could be sponsors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think that turning this into a game is a good approach, at least not in the sense several other organizations are working on - including yours. That has its merits but it is being covered. I want this to have very broad appeal and be a platform for discussion. I have ideas about how to make it layered so that people can get the level of education they want as they interact with the environment, and mostly enjoy experiencing it. The idea is more like Minecraft or Sims than a goal-oriented game. And playing with the models would be entirely optional, you could just look around and click on things as you wish to find out about them, or click once to be taken on a walk-through. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backing it up, for those who are so inclined, would be an entrance to this forum (or rather it's more developed successor), tucked in a few places around the virtual colony. There visitors would see the top threads displayed and could open it in a new tab. However they would need to have thoroughly checked through the virtual colony and completed several tasks in order to gain access to the forum. Perhaps in that forum, or maybe in a connected blog or some such thing, i'll probably go on occasional tirades about how very important this all is. It will be in the process of reaching beyond this planet in a serious way that we learn to identify ourselves as one species, on one of many planets, in a vast universe in which our previous ideas of cosmic truth are too limiting and must be expanded.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8474282175849089267/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/big-picture.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8474282175849089267'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8474282175849089267'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/big-picture.html' title='Big picture?

It was originally posted there on Nov 6th, 2015)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a deceptively simple model of Fresnel lenses focusing bands of sunlight on regolith fines that have been delivered and smoothed level by the crane. It's deceptive for several reasons. For instance, for me, it didn't feel simple deciding if the crane should level the fine-grain material or there should be dedicated robotic gizmos doing that, if the stuff should be tamped (i think no), whether the lenses should move on rails or suspended cables, et cetera. Also deceptive because you can't see the motorized gizmos that move the lenses around and aim them, even though they have a lot of detail. But enough whining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-viPpDUYgj0M/V5J6R3k3NfI/AAAAAAAAWHw/qVSZ3HLsrmkm7MVbF6dkN_bfNb7xBVZBQCK4B/s1600/20151106184409563cf4f9e86bb.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="182" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-viPpDUYgj0M/V5J6R3k3NfI/AAAAAAAAWHw/qVSZ3HLsrmkm7MVbF6dkN_bfNb7xBVZBQCK4B/s320/20151106184409563cf4f9e86bb.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those lenses are roughly 7 m across. With about 1366 W/m^2 of solar energy to work with, and allowing that 10% will be reflected off the lenses, each one is thus focusing about 47 kW of energy onto the ground. Toasty. Maybe the thing would be to craft each one to focus to a different shape - one to a point, and the other three to bands of different widths. The positioning gizmos can raise and lower them to spread that 47 kW over the right area to get the depth and rate of melting for the application at hand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What that boils down to (heh) i don't know. Because of the very jagged and irregular shapes of regolith particles, even at maximum compaction it is about half voids. It transmits heat very poorly. And heat would be coming in really fast. As top layers melt, they are going to sink into the regolith and leave a hole. That is why the fused regolith components shown in the illustration lie in troughs. The bottoms and sides of the shapes created could be quite irregular, shifting from pure fused material to a crust of bubbly stuff with an ever increasing proportion of voids. All shapes will be rounded - didn't get that in the model yet, i'll have to modify it later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it's so damn simple, just get used to it and make allowance for its properties, and you have a constant supply of building materials using nothing more than a few simple motors and very basic components. So what if they maybe aren't that sturdy for their size - use more of 'em, you can make them fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sapphire lenses will last for decades. They and their positioning gizmos can be lifted off their rails at nightfall and taken by the crane into the dome under construction, where the residual heat from the day's lava production will protect all your gear from the deep freeze of night. Maybe throw a reflective sheet over everything, you're done. Nothing fancy here, that's super good when trying to build a base in space.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/6390263567078417672/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/melt-in-place-fabrication.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6390263567078417672'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/6390263567078417672'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/melt-in-place-fabrication.html' title='Melt-in-place fabrication'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-viPpDUYgj0M/V5J6R3k3NfI/AAAAAAAAWHw/qVSZ3HLsrmkm7MVbF6dkN_bfNb7xBVZBQCK4B/s72-c/20151106184409563cf4f9e86bb.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-5394155603976935834</id><published>2016-07-22T12:54:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T12:54:38.947-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Components of Phase 1 VMC - Dome Builder, new and improved</title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Oct 9th, 2015)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing about building a dome out of a spiraling trough of fabric filled with tamped regolith is that the width of each level has to change, as does the radius of the open span. The Tube Filler i posted before might not be unreasonable for vertical walls - i mean, of course it is a highly simplified sketch, but i think all the basic steps are there. So, instead of building a new model that would work for a dome, i could have simply substituted an architectural design with vertical walls. I have two i want to draw up anyhow. For that matter, i've considered two alternate methods for building a dome, as well. But no, i wanted to finish what i started.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jNvKKfQBmmA/V5J4-IfGXqI/AAAAAAAAWHY/xg-7IWTgT90DMifFo_2ayHlIOHqbuzKjwCK4B/s1600/2015100921202456182f98ad4b9.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="258" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jNvKKfQBmmA/V5J4-IfGXqI/AAAAAAAAWHY/xg-7IWTgT90DMifFo_2ayHlIOHqbuzKjwCK4B/s400/2015100921202456182f98ad4b9.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, i know, it looks like a crazy mish-mash. I'm not going to even try to explain it here. I'm positing that the last 3 days, which were entirely spent building it, including staying up til 2 a.m. last night, are worth it for the practice actually thinking through a construction process. Other people who actually know about these things are going to be critical to this process, but the better i can understand what they are saying, the more we can get done. Right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the time that remains before the conference i'm going to try to number all the bits of all these models, write up short summaries of what they are and how they work, and also place them together in a mock-up of Phase 1 of Cernan's Promise under construction. In theory, that should go faster than all this virtual model building. I have practise, no banging my head against my basic ignorance of the program and the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Da-vtM1RlCU/V5J5WBZweUI/AAAAAAAAWHk/ydlwJpG3CJYYNb_fx5L3EWyCQCLv07yeQCK4B/s1600/201510092149415618367545e8c.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="251" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Da-vtM1RlCU/V5J5WBZweUI/AAAAAAAAWHk/ydlwJpG3CJYYNb_fx5L3EWyCQCLv07yeQCK4B/s320/201510092149415618367545e8c.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of things are floating in mid-air because i didn't want to take the time to make all the supports. Especially since a lot of things need to pivot or slide. The orange bits are where such things happen. In pondering the number of small motors and precise movements that would involve, i became convinced how important it would be to have everything be done 'manually'. That is, invest in small, agile robots that go around performing such tasks, and save a ton on motors and tricky mechanisms that only hugely multiply the number of places where a failure would cause everything to grind to a halt. This sketch shows 4 robotic arms in total, but probably it would be better to 'man' the Dome Builder with two robots capable of crawling over it to perform different tasks, or two robot 'torsos' (not equiped to change location) that can be clipped to one station or another as needed. Many tasks are only occasional, after all - reloading bolts of cloth and spools of cord, cranking various gears to telescope various pieces as the width of higher levels increases. The crane could come and move a robot when needed. Most of the time they would be busy installing the solid basalt components that reinforce the levels.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/5394155603976935834/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/components-of-phase-1-vmc-dome-builder.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/5394155603976935834'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/5394155603976935834'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/components-of-phase-1-vmc-dome-builder.html' title='Components of Phase 1 VMC - Dome Builder, new and improved'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jNvKKfQBmmA/V5J4-IfGXqI/AAAAAAAAWHY/xg-7IWTgT90DMifFo_2ayHlIOHqbuzKjwCK4B/s72-c/2015100921202456182f98ad4b9.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8718977964516934672</id><published>2016-07-22T12:39:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T12:48:01.897-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Components of Phase 1 VMC - Mark III Lava Makers</title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Oct 6th, 2015)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a new lava maker after being concerned about the weaknesses of the parabolic bowl mirror i posted yesterday. This one is a bit less complete, i keep trying to tell myself i need to hurry now and leave details for later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #222222; color: #cccccc; font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13.1213px; line-height: 19.682px;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BvrkFcXOzvU/V5J0-x6HQnI/AAAAAAAAWGk/FsrdZSvoQYwTlR1E8_8WCRHAek8Eb_JzQCK4B/s1600/2015100620142656142ba221be1.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="243" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BvrkFcXOzvU/V5J0-x6HQnI/AAAAAAAAWGk/FsrdZSvoQYwTlR1E8_8WCRHAek8Eb_JzQCK4B/s320/2015100620142656142ba221be1.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we get around the issue of melting secondary mirrors and wasting energy by simply putting the lava tank at the focal point of the heat. I'd thought of this before but wasn't sure how to handle access to the tank. Splitting the mirror into two halves that are slightly separated helps a lot. All the support infrastructure is out of the mirror's light, and it doesn't need to rotate, it is at the axis of rotation and the mirrors rotate around it. It just means several components have twin halves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That makes for a somewhat awkward tank shape. The orange half-egg dome shape that can only be seen in the reflection here is hit by the focused sunlight, as is one on the other end. The focal points would be at the centers of those dome areas, so the beams on them there would be small half-circles of very intense light, and as the mirrors rotated over the course of a day the half-circles would travel around the domes' bottom halves. The light blue parts are reflective insulation hoods (and the main body of the tank has such insulation as well*). The hoods over the domes are connected to the spokes that go to the strut systems backing the mirrors - they rotate as the mirrors rotate. Thus in this version, the heat is received on the ends of the tank, and has to diffuse through its contents from there. Again my guess is the materials that make sense are graphite and tungsten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flared hopper at the top is where the crane drops in regolith. It would have a lid within it that can be opened for that, and then shuts air-tight, and maybe it should also have insulation that can be closed over it. The green parts are my tremendously ignorant guess at what a gas collection system on the tank might look like. It is basically there to represent the idea. Oxygen collection systems can be integrated into this design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple part is the area where motors would go that slowly rotate the ring at the center of the spoke system 180 degrees over 14 days. A few rollers would need to be spaced around the twin cradles the twin rings sit in. I wonder what the best design is for a motor that moves so slowly. I suppose it would be possible to not have motors, and just swing the crane around every two hours and turn the ring one notch, shifting the mirrors by 1 degree. Maybe there could be a crank system somewhere, so a rover could also come do the job if the crane is busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this design could also be a half-bowl instead of a full-bowl, like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CP60RTu2CgU/V5J4Wqdr0XI/AAAAAAAAWHI/gd9KgHTKeTMVWkjxw_EpGsBC0hanOg59gCK4B/s1600/20151006205800561435d8cfb5a.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CP60RTu2CgU/V5J4Wqdr0XI/AAAAAAAAWHI/gd9KgHTKeTMVWkjxw_EpGsBC0hanOg59gCK4B/s320/20151006205800561435d8cfb5a.jpg" width="276" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here you can see the spout for emptying the contents of the tank, sticking out rather obscenely. It isn't really visible in the top image, in that version it sticks out of the part at the back of the tank. Who knows how many times a tank could be filled and emptied over one lunar day. As many times as possible would be the goal. Aside from where the limitations of the materials and resources fix that number, it might be good to leave the lava boiling for some time at an extra-hot temperature. Like yesterday's design, the goal here is to raise the temperature of the whole internal volume to at least 2500 Celsius, and sustain that temperature so the mix releases oxygen which can be collected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a small version from further away so you can see the whole thing. No fancy struts on the backs of the mirrors this time. Just imagine it has the same setup as the heliostats from yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fxkCQB9W8K8/V5J4atRtS3I/AAAAAAAAWHQ/LqssWOESoAAPTCEbYN44k1I4rZFZfInsACK4B/s1600/2015100621331656143e1c18c90.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fxkCQB9W8K8/V5J4atRtS3I/AAAAAAAAWHQ/LqssWOESoAAPTCEbYN44k1I4rZFZfInsACK4B/s320/2015100621331656143e1c18c90.jpg" width="247" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;* of course reflective insulation would melt if it was actually in contact with the tank anywhere - the model doesn't show the separation because that was faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8718977964516934672/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_22.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8718977964516934672'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8718977964516934672'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/note-following-is-one-of-various-posts_22.html' title='Components of Phase 1 VMC - Mark III Lava Makers'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BvrkFcXOzvU/V5J0-x6HQnI/AAAAAAAAWGk/FsrdZSvoQYwTlR1E8_8WCRHAek8Eb_JzQCK4B/s72-c/2015100620142656142ba221be1.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-1458710162572455517</id><published>2016-07-22T12:27:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T12:27:03.523-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'> Components of Phase 1 VMC - The Lava Maker</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="background-color: #222222; color: #cccccc; font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 0.82em; line-height: 1.5em; max-width: 60em;"&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 18.48px;"&gt;(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project.

In the proportions shown here, the resulting beam of sunlight is concentrated by a factor of nearly 300. That might be too much. Heat dynamics is way beyond me, so the thermal concentration here may be fine, or it might melt everything even if it is made of a tungsten skin over a graphite interior and has a radiator on top (currently not shown). My guess is the 2nd option is more likely. The concentration factor can of course be adjusted to whatever works best. Still, the higher it can be pushed, the better, right?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="background-color: #222222; color: #cccccc; font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 0.82em; line-height: 1.5em; max-width: 60em;"&gt;The mirrors themselves could be a thick layer of aluminum to deal with the constant loss of aluminum from the surface due to its low vapor pressure. By circulating a liquid (a molten salt?) through channels in the graphite the heat could be used to turn a micro-turbine before being cooled in the radiator. Thus some use would made of it. Perhaps not worth the added complexity though. There is a microwave transmitter attached to the counterweight near the pivot of the whole thing in this model, which went with the idea the microturbine idea could be worth it. It passes the power generated to the crane for distribution.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="background-color: #222222; color: #cccccc; font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 0.82em; line-height: 1.5em; max-width: 60em;"&gt;The crucible holding the lava, by contrast, would be surrounded by reflective insulation (except where the light beam hits it) to limit heat loss. Its whole interior volume needs to reach 1500 Celsius at least to produce lava, and really the target is 2500 Celsius or more. At that temperature, oxygen can be produced in volume.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="background-color: #222222; color: #cccccc; font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 0.82em; line-height: 1.5em; max-width: 60em;"&gt;The idea of this configuration is to keep a volume of lava boiling away for an extended period of time. I think that is what is needed to have a process like oxygen production be effective. A cylinder that is say 1 unit wide by three high might also separate into layers over the night as its contents slowly cooled, right? Which would mean its different constituents could be separated and then processed further.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/1458710162572455517/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/components-of-phase-1-vmc-lava-maker.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1458710162572455517'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/1458710162572455517'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/components-of-phase-1-vmc-lava-maker.html' title=' Components of Phase 1 VMC - The Lava Maker'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ynfaUbAKzQQ/V5JzS_UmJkI/AAAAAAAAWGI/VTWyku2b2zQlK5EWaD-7q5Dst23wEouQgCK4B/s72-c/201510052058325612e478df361.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-8575139263570810415</id><published>2016-07-22T12:19:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T12:23:38.863-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Components of Phase 1 VMC - the Tube Filler </title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="background-color: #333333; color: #cccccc; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 18.48px;"&gt;(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project.

It's fine for when the dome wall is almost vertical, but as it curves inwards it becomes increasingly problematic. Which means the tubes should really be troughs, and the rods going across them should really be 3 pieces that are fused together when installed to form a sort of H shape, with angles created between the crossbar and the two outer rods that conforms to the angle of the dome at that height. Hm. I wonder if i have time to rebuild this. I'm a lot better at Blender than i was when i made it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, some of the principles still hold. The crane delivers loads of loose regolith to this moving trough placing mechanism. Fabric is dispensed from rolls on the front, welded together into one sheet as it rolls out using a gizmo at the front. Since it is made of basalt, welding the fabric is just a matter of two plates at just the right temperature pressing the cloth together as it passes through it, then cooling it so it is stable as it passes on. A spool of basalt cord is used to stitch the sides of the trough together. The vibrating drum won't really work because this trough is going to continuously get wider as the dome gets higher and the angles get closer to horizontal. Tampers usually work with a vibrating plate anyhow. So the system needs two or three of those, and they need to be on rails so they can travel back and forth across the width of the trough. That means boulders will need to be fused to this thing so its center of mass is in the right place and it is stable as it rolls along. And it will need to telescope to be ever wider as trough width widens with height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a second rolling contraption will be needed i think. One that does detail work with the reinforcing rods after the filler passes. It needs to ensure that the joints between rods are strong, by reinforcing them with lava gobs, and it can add cross-bracing rods, forming Xs on the inner and outer facades between the Hs that traverse the thickness of the walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I complain a lot that i'm not getting things done as fast as i want to. This is a good example of why.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://moonwards1.blogspot.com/feeds/8575139263570810415/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/components-of-phase-1-vmc-tube-filler.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8575139263570810415'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/8575139263570810415'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/07/components-of-phase-1-vmc-tube-filler.html' title='Components of Phase 1 VMC - the Tube Filler '/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/117376171817157375537</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VMVSgSzbMD8/V5JyomNGSQI/AAAAAAAAWF8/97gYSBb4G3sVMgPg4V8ehJIwkZ-3qzqAgCK4B/s72-c/201510052013265612d9e682f62.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-2965061638899507006</id><published>2016-07-22T12:19:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-22T12:20:36.811-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Components of Phase 1 VMC - Dome under construction </title><content type='html'>(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the Moonwards.com forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project.

It is crunch time now for the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group annual meeting, that i leave to attend in 2 weeks. I've been making models for the last few weeks, i'm not very good at it yet because i'm mostly learning as i go, but they are good enough to explain the main concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one comes first, a dome 40 meters across under construction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span id="goog_272055147"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="goog_272055148"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G2ydc6XulOE/V5JxYChmlzI/AAAAAAAAWFw/IrtAImq7nicKjTx8UBfzEVhnYGaJ9ccuwCK4B/s1600/201510051724355612b2536b337.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G2ydc6XulOE/V5JxYChmlzI/AAAAAAAAWFw/IrtAImq7nicKjTx8UBfzEVhnYGaJ9ccuwCK4B/s400/201510051724355612b2536b337.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to figure out how to get the models to render better for these images. Anyhow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This illustration shows a continuous tube construction system for the dome. It doesn't show the tube filling and placement system - but there is a model for that, it will go in the next post. So really the tubes that have been laid should be in a spiral, and the Tube Filler (i'm so tempted to give it some much funkier name*) should be visible trundling along, continuing to spiral upwards and inwards until the inward curve of the half-sphere being made reaches about 30 degrees. Then it is done and a different system is used to close off the remaining span, which would be about half the width and a fifth of the height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That different system is illustrated in the roof structure of the - what, the foyer of the dome? That has 2 levels. The main level will eventually get airlocks in that doorway - which is about 3.5 m tall and 2 m wide, so equipment can be moved through it. The upper level is only connected to the dome interior and is pressurized when the whole thing is finished. The roof is sustained by the basalt beams at its corners. So the lava mold and melt-in-place operations need to produce those beams - (though narrower profiles could be placed at first and then built up with more lava troweled on when it is thick or spattered on when it is more viscous). Basalt cloth is stretched between those beams, a layer on the outside and a layer on the inside, and filled with regolith, tamped tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heliostat is shown connected to the window. (It lacks some details, but the configuration is accurate. There are bits missing from the supports and the gear box and motor to turn it to track the sun aren't there. Also the smaller mirrors that transfer the light to the interior probably should have some thickness and mass to ensure they don't melt or deform - magnesia or graphite mass, chromium mirror surface, sapphire outer surface protecting the mirror surface?) It is large enough to fill the interior of the foyer with sunlight more intense than the full noon-day sun on Earth, all through the 2 weeks of lunar daylight. (Actually maybe i should scale it down a bit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heliostats just like it, but bigger, would be attached to the main dome at the height where the tube filler finishes its job. One on the north side, and one on the south side. As Cernan's Promise is almost right on the equator, both would get full sun all day long. Pass the light from them into the dome and onto surfaces designed to scatter it throughout the dome. If those heliostats are sized to fill the dome with light as intense as full noon sun on earth, those scattering surfaces are going to heat up a great deal. So put channels in the basalt mass behind those surfaces, created when layers of lava are built up, put some water in them, and create a micro steam turbine system. Get electricity out of that heat, and spread it out too, making use of the dome's thermal mass to create an even warmth comfortable for people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that comes later and i really hope i have time to mock up a quick model of that stage before i leave, most of the elements are already done. Really i said that to get to the next point. The level where the tube filler stops is a convenient point to switch to building up lava facades on the inside and outside of the dome, and creating a strong ring of solid basalt at that height, and installing the heliostats there. The span that is open to the sky will help the lava to cool and properly solidify by the time the robots are ready to complete the cap of the dome. During that time lava has to be spread over the whole floor and built up to a good thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image shows the beginning of that process. First, tiles of lava are attached to the rods distributed between tube levels during placement. (Maybe they come from the melt-in-place lava facility, loose regolith that has been raked to remove chunks and smoothed level should melt evenly enough as a beam of concentrated sunlight is passed over it that tiles can be produced.) Inside and outside, the whole dome gets those tiles. Next, those tiles allow solid basalt to be built up. Lava can't be applied directly to the tubes, or the fabric will melt away and the regolith will fall out. But if the tiles deform a bit when lava is troweled over them it doesn't matter, they just have to allow the solid basalt portion to be unified so that a solid basalt dome builds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as i've written this out i've thought of weaknesses and possible improvements, which is why i do it this way. I wanted to mock up this method first, but there are several ways this could be approached. Now that i've done this i'm not sure this is actually the fastest and most efficient way. Well, this is a process, after all.

But I&amp;#39;m wondering about the difference in what materials would be available on the Moon compared to the Earth. And its implication for architecture and even culture. There will be no wood, plastics or textiles on the Moon, right? Instead glass, ceramics, light metals. Things like furniture and utensils would be made out of magnesium, which would be a pretty exotic thing on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can soft things be manufactured from Moon materials? What kind of clothes would one make there?

You could make inflatables that only need a small amount of sealant from Earth, and use those as mattresses. Or you could make hammocks of basalt cloth, and take the time to shape them and give them a frame so they are comfortable to sleep in (which i don&amp;#39;t find to be the case with hammocks on Earth for any length of time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the point you make is also a good one - how much padding do you need if you are in 1/6th gravity? Consider that in such a place the weight you bear on the soles of your feet when you are standing is less than the weight your butt bears on Earth when you are sitting. It might not only be healthier to stand all the time on the Moon, but genuinely more comfortable. But when you want to relax enough to sleep well, the familiarity of a mattress would probably help with that. So it is good that there are options for that in the early days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure there will always be important roles for plastic, as it is such a versatile set of substances, but only for where nothing else will work. Once carbonaceous asteroids can be put into orbit, and there is high-capacity transport by means of tethers that make mining of those, and of any deposits on the Moon, possible, there will be some plastics. I bet that with the characteristics of lunar glasses, either based on basalt or other mixtures of common minerals there, many everyday objects would be glass. Lunar minerals are free of the effects of hydration, and they are highly reduced - they have extra electrons. The best guess is that this means lunar glass will be stronger than Earth glass. Maybe not a great material for forks... But glass chairs sound perfectly fine. After all, glass can be formed into nice natural curves that fit your body. If you want to sit at all, of course. For finely detailed stuff, i bet on iron. Magnesium tends to react with water. So does iron, but at least it doesn&amp;#39;t do so violently. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is so much to think about... I find it rather fun. :)</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/3071951781888582180'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/3071951781888582180'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html?showComment=1473639848486#c3071951781888582180' title=''/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/03515999797604957157</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAV-8/i4NWboH0Rnk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-4782728319088672584' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4782728319088672584' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-14670607'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='September 11, 2016 at 5:24 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-873815684888940280</id><published>2016-09-30T22:39:35.801-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-30T22:39:35.801-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>There are very few visionaries out there with the ...</title><content type='html'>There are very few visionaries out there with the imagination to visualise things in such detail I love the website it inspires discussion which is what is required to make dreams reality. With such vision there is always the realisation that this vision has to be shared by many others with a whole lot of other skills to make this happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often wondered why we never built a habitat on the moon and instead are looking at a far more ambitious project like Mars when the theoretical issues could have already been explored on our nearest neighbour at little cost and within our current technological scope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess those with vision are always chasing  the new challenge. Because they haven’t been to Mars, but have been many times to the moon, they don’t see that as interesting any more. To be first for visionaries is always the first priority before they move on. &lt;br /&gt;Those of us that have not shared in that experience are left to try ant imagine what it would be like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder about the solar aspect when you have 336 hours of darkness at night this will make thermal mass heat retention a problem. Perhaps some form of bio-heat production from waste producing heat as well as methane for additional heat input within a circulated water system.&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/873815684888940280'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/873815684888940280'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html?showComment=1475300375801#c873815684888940280' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/3071951781888582180'/><author><name>sam D</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/15790015200913021005</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1bGkEB0sXOs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/V-OIBdUarBg/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-4782728319088672584' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4782728319088672584' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1919381061'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='September 30, 2016 at 10:39 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-187607479819477073</id><published>2016-09-30T22:40:18.270-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-30T22:40:18.270-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>We can have artificial light of course for the dar...</title><content type='html'>We can have artificial light of course for the darkness or sun pipes for underground light during the 14 day daylight phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will always impact on our mental health as well as the long term weakening of us physically at 1 sixth gravity and the health issues that this may manifest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuclear power would as you say be the only real source of reliable energy. I’m not sure about Methane but liquid Thorium salt or similar perhaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have considered radiation  meteor strikes which may be a problem with no atmosphere to burn up particles. &lt;br /&gt;I consider caves or as you say Lava tubes as places where little resources would be required to fabricate and build structures that would be robust enough to protect against radiation and metors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This option gives limitless scope for expansion with little need to fabricate structures and engineer containment.Thermal regulation would be greatly enhanced either protection from heat or cold. This  would vastly reduces the need for multiple fabrication processes that would be required to build complex and integrity resilient structures. This reduces payload drastically as well as cost. Most of the construction could be directed remotely or with limited equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reflector concentrator I assume could be used to melt a tube in the basalt into say a crater face although I have my doubts that the structure of the crater walls are basalt Im no geologist or expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nitrogen will be a critical element in maintaining pressure integrity I would assume a sealed basalt or rock cave or tube treated by some form of coating would provide excellent integrity with little  risk other than perhaps seismic fracturing if this is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube with multiple air locks would provide excellent barriers and safeguards against failure. Tubes could be expanded with little more than excavating material that can be used as you say for production of materials perhaps directly within the excavated deposits. &lt;br /&gt;This of corse would depend on geology and stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Food production would depend on supplementing sunlight daily  to compensate for long nights some form of alge based food perhaps ideally we would want to grow something more palatable and provide some simulation that allowed for plant growth to remind us of home.&lt;br /&gt;I worry that this would be a community more for the scientific community or as a temporary place to live rather than people wanting to live there permanently when earth would be the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we are talking of a stepping stone to inter planetary exploration That would defiantly work if we could establish a space industry that had the benefit of fabricating spacecraft with less constraints on size capable of escaping the earths considerable gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resupply from earth would  provide recyclable plastics which could be used in 3D printers to fabricate components.

For the parts of the habitat that are underground (which is almost everything), heat is also conducted by contact, but powder regolith is excellent insulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the website, if you look at the model of the finished dugout, there is a spot where it mentions that tubing would be laid in channels cut into the huge boulders located at its north end - each of which is the size of a large house - and water would be circulated through them for temperature regulation. The stone arches covering the dugout may also have tubing along the top of each one so water can be circulated through them to shed heat at night &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea there is that with time, the issue is going to be how to shed excess heat that has collected in the habitat during the day. Those boulders can suck up a lot of heat but eventually they will not cool below room temperature even overnight. I have thought about making a simple, movable shade of reflective foil for them so the sun doesn&amp;#39;t reach them in the day. The value of the thermal mass in the dugout is that it takes long enough for temperatures to change that you can use much simpler and smaller heat regulation systems to stay within a comfortable range. I believe the very simple system i mention here would be enough.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/8447040371390354210'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/8447040371390354210'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html?showComment=1475363460054#c8447040371390354210' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/3071951781888582180'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/03515999797604957157</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAV-8/i4NWboH0Rnk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-4782728319088672584' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4782728319088672584' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-14670607'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 1, 2016 at 4:11 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-7834299079490653707</id><published>2016-10-01T17:34:09.132-07:00</published><updated>2016-10-01T17:34:09.132-07:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>There is a lot here to respond to.

If you could pump with your legs, bird-like wings would be more feasible. Also the big trick is to get going, then you just need to maintain forward momentum so the lift on the wings reduces your workload. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vision for building high is tied to putting domes over large areas - in this case, all of Lalande Crater, which is 22 km across. As with all buildings, the stress on that dome will come from containing the pressure of the atmosphere inside it, not from supporting its own weight - even with 6 m of water over the whole thing for radiation protection. So, you might as well anchor it at many points across its span and create a segmented dome. And if you have already placed huge cables for such anchors, then you can build around them and that would only reinforce the whole thing. The center towers in that setup will be about 5 km high, and be true buildings from top to bottom.

It makes your growing model more relevant, congratulations! I feel optimistic that astronauts will jump around on the Moon again within a decade. I hope you can bring your ideas about your &amp;quot;handsome crater&amp;quot; in Lalaland to a wider audience. Crewed Lunar missions will be great public and popular happenings now that we have internet and these kinds of visualization techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you feel like making a parallel design of how Lunar exploration might realistically actually start out now, from the first landing to the first permanent Lunar base and such industry you suggest here? As with NASA&amp;#39;s selection of landing sites for Mars rovers, I suppose that NASA&amp;#39;s options for Moon exploration will be publicly discussed too. One might build these kind of models of them and project future development based on such initial plans.

It is so easy to get confident too soon in this scene. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been working away on setting up the models, website, and documentation needed to attract a wide audience. It has become rather frustrating that for all the work, there remains little visible change. Everything takes much longer than i think, mostly because i am doing all of it for the first time. I guess that makes it just a little like space exploration itself. I believe this needs to be done with great care, great attention to detail and conviction. It is taking time for me to feel it has the foundation it needs before aggressively broadcasting it. It should be ready just in time to really take advantage of this new attention. Cross your fingers for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rest of what you say, sir, you have pushed my buttons and i am compelled to write a new blog entry in response.

Any new feature maybe meant to save the user&amp;#39;s time, ends up consuming more time because new things can be done with it, and that is irresistible. It&amp;#39;s written in da book that God created the world in six days. That is the first obvious lie in the Bible. If He exists he is still working on it, that&amp;#39;s why He created infinity. There is no finishing it. After having rested a while, and realizing that the rest is good, on the 8th day He created hourly wage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as one enjoys what one is doing it isn&amp;#39;t really a cost. If a Lunar exploration program actually takes off now (I&amp;#39;m maybe too optimistic about that), you here have a foot in the door to the potentially huge popular hype that will surround it during the next decade. Your concept could evolve to something much more interesting and interactive than that Mars TV series running now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be possible to use this world with Virtual Reality gears? Imagine playing a kind of Pokemon Go on the VR-Moon. I think you should span your wings with this and see how far you can fly. At least if there will really be a Moon fever in a few years.

Sorry to be replying...</title><content type='html'>That sounds like a great job. Sorry to be replying so late, i must have gotten caught up in something else and forgotten. You contacted me at a very busy time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me clarify a few things. Nuclear thermal rockets work by heating a fuel to very high temperatures very quickly and releasing the vapor out the nozzles. The back end of such rockets look the same as normal chemical rockets, with hot vapors jetting out nozzles. Hydrogen is the most efficient fuel for NTRs. The methane is an efficient way to ship hydrogen in this case. Shipping liquid hydrogen comes with a lot of problems, and though 3/4 of the mass of methane is carbon, that&amp;#39;s a very useful chemical you&amp;#39;d be shipping anyhow. Thorium salt reactors would indeed be the best thing in the long term, as Lalande crater is a hotspot of thorium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lava tubes have been considered a lot, because large ones are known to exist on the Moon. I&amp;#39;m not focusing on them because i don&amp;#39;t think many people would want to live in a cave long-term. There are other solutions to radiation and meteoroids - and at any rate, we will definitely have to build most things outside caves. They aren&amp;#39;t going to be where we need them most of the time. There are other solutions to radiation and meteoroids that work better, they just need more infrastructure, which is exactly what we are going to the Moon to create, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some seismic activity on the Moon. Moonquakes are not very intense but it has to be assumed cracks are going to happen sometimes in habitat walls. Cracks are easily sealed by applying a thin coat of basalt lava. Finding the cracks may be the most difficult thing, but it isn&amp;#39;t hard to simply re-coat large areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark areas of the Moon are all basalt. Lalande is on the edge of one basalt &amp;#39;sea&amp;#39; and it is quite possible parts of its walls will be highlands materials with a very different chemistry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The further you send sunlight down fiber-optic cables, the less comes out the other end, instead being lost as heat along the way. I really don&amp;#39;t know what distance is reasonable for such a device. I&amp;#39;m working on a version that uses a straight sapphire rod to do the boring and reduces the number of times the sun is reflected before being emitted at the other end, that should help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there are a few things covered. I have to focus on writing up documentation for all this kind of thing on the website and i don&amp;#39;t always have time to respond to comments for that reason. I have only one collaborator right now, and he can only help with certain things. I&amp;#39;m really swamped most of the time. </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/2474329001913959681'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/2474329001913959681'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html?showComment=1482613753214#c2474329001913959681' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/4782728319088672584/comments/default/187607479819477073'/><author><name>kim holder</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/03515999797604957157</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh4.googleusercontent.com/-HQ1xeS9xlPc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAWTc/r0v_WewVvNk/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://moonwards1.blogspot.com/2016/09/all-reasons-why.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2741304674651227490.post-4782728319088672584' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/2741304674651227490/posts/default/4782728319088672584' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-14670607'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='December 24, 2016 at 1:09 PM'/></entry></feed>
