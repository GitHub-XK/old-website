			<h1>Rovers and Robots - the Workhorses</h1>
			<p>
				In this project, the approach is taken that the first missions to settle
				the Moon will focus on developing the robotic infrastructure needed to
				do construction entirely without humans present. Such robots do not yet
				exist, but the field is advancing quickly. Development of that
				technology has a wealth of applications here on Earth, it would make
				sense to make such R&D a central part of a settlement space program.
				A few missions
				would be needed where a minimal crew go to support the prototype robots,
				testing and fixing them, until there is confidence the robots can be
				operated remotely from Earth. After that, the robots build the
				first permanent habitat and its infrastructure without
				anyone on-site. Once that hab is near completion,
				again a crew
				arrives. They test everything, maybe make some minor final touches.
				Then they stay.
				After that the human population ramps up quickly and they operate the
				robotic machinery from within the habs.
				<br><br>
				So, great things come from great robots. Rovers in space are already
				designed to handle factors not present on Earth. Rovers and robots on
				the Moon will have extra challenges that have not yet been solved. The
				list below takes them in ascending order of difficulty:
			</p>
				<ul>
				<li>The	high radiation environment, which requires special design of computer
					components. This technology is well developed, but does add cost and
				  increases the bulk of components.</li>
				<li>The 290 K temperature swing between day and night. Two key things
				are important here:
					<ul>
						<li>Thermal wadis - which are masses of solid stone
				that store heat far better than the powdery soil. If a rover can
				snuggle up to one and throw a reflective tarp over itself to slow
				heat loss, the cold it has to withstand overnight is greatly reduced.
				</li>
					<li>Nuclear power - there is no reason to fear nuclear power on the
						Moon. It is a great way to get through the long cold night, when
						there is no solar power. Robots working at night can run their
						heaters by drawing power beamed to them as microwaves from the
						nuclear power plant
					</li>
				</ul> </li>
				<li>
				The extremely abrasive, finely
				powdered soil that will grind away at any moving part it gets into.
				And it comes with static cling. Some things can be wrapped to minimize
				the dust that enters. Magnetic brushes seem quite effective for
				dusting things off, though they haven't been tested on-site.
				Ultimately, the best thing is to fuse the surface soil into a
				solid cap of stone wherever robots
				work (or people).
			</li>
			<li>
				The 3 second round-trip transmission delay between Earth and Moon,
				that will need to be designed for to make remote operation work.
				So, if a robot is tipping over, it needs to look after that itself.
				It needs to be able to handle simple, repetitive tasks on its own.
				It needs protocols for collision avoidance. It needs to understand
				what it is looking at well enough to direct itself as it moves around
				and manipulates things.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p> The videos in the sidebar show we've made
		big advances on these things, but there is a ways to go. It is
		hard to overstate how much of a difference robots with these
		capabilities make. They are absolutely necessary for success.

				<h1>Construction and Fabrication - the Road to Big Business </h1>
				<p>If there was a way to build a habitable shelter on the
					Moon that wasn't super hard, we'd already be there. It
					is important not to underestimate how hard it is to do
					this. But, the needed technology is coming together and
					turns out to change the equation of what the best method is.
					<br><br>
					Most designs for lunar construction up to now have
					focused on batch processes that don't require much
					finesse (such as making lunar concrete blocks). Few
					designs have contemplated use of in situ materials,
					though, because of the difficulty of delivering
					the machinery to work them, and the probability
					such machinery wouldn't last long in such a harsh
					environment. Almost all serious designs send
					finished modules built on Earth.
					<br><br>
					If you plan to stay, you have to be able to build there.
					If you can build there, you have something you can
					sell. If you are good at it, you can build for space, too,
					and that's our whole idea.
					<br><br>
					All construction designs here are centered around the use
					of melted regolith, in particular the basalt of the lunar
					maria. When basalt is drawn into fibers it has
					good tension strength. A material that is strong in tension
					is the key to space development. Holding in an atmosphere
					requires it. Possibly the minerals of the highlands could
					also be melted and spun into glass fibers with decent
					strength. Glass fibers on Earth can't bear much tension,
					but the different chemistry of lunar minerals may mean they
					have much higher tensile strength.
					<br><br>
					All these designs absolutely depend on the use of agile
					robots. They don't have to be carpenters, but they do
					need the manual skills of your typical 5 year old.
					Guided by human operators on Earth, that would be enough.
					Several development missions would need to go to the Moon
					to test and refine that technology.
					<br><br>
					If you have those robots, what follows is the best way to
					build. By far, no contest. So, if you perhaps calculate that
					such robots are a long way off, still by the time Cernan's
					Promise was fully developed, they would exist and have been
					used for the bulk of that construction. We can quibble
					later about the most plausible way to
					present the first few missions, when those robots are in
					development and can't be relied on. The winds blow very
					strongly towards their development, so
					it is sound policy to explore what they can do.
