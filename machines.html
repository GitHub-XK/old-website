						<h1>The Machines that make it Possible</h1>
						<p>Even to reach space we need incredibly complex machines. To live
							there we will need machines that can do any physical task we can,
							see as well or better, that anticipate, compensate, and make
							judgement calls. Recent advancements in robotics stand beside
							reusable rockets as new factors accelerating our advance into space.
							The Moon's harsh surface is no place for a human to work.
							Spacesuits make you very clumsy, and a ton of infrastructure is
							needed to keep you alive and safe. Bring on the robots.

			<h1>Rovers and Robots - the Workhorses</h1>
			<p>
				In this project, the approach is taken that the first missions to settle
				the Moon will focus on developing the robotic infrastructure needed to
				do construction entirely without humans present. Such robots do not yet
				exist, but the field is advancing quickly and development of that
				technology has a wealth of applications here on Earth. A few missions
				would be needed where a minimal crew go to support the prototype robots,
				testing and fixing them, until there is confidence the robots can be
				operated remotely from Earth. After that, construction proceeds without
				anyone on-site. Once the atrium hab is near completion, again a crew
				arrives. They test the hab, maybe fix a few things. Then they stay.
				After that the human population ramps up quickly and they operate the
				robotic machinery from within the habs.
				<br><br>
				So, great things come from great robots. Rovers in space are already
				designed to handle factors not present on Earth. Rovers and robots on
				the Moon will have extra challenges that have not yet been solved. The
				list below takes them in ascending order of difficulty:
			</p>
				<ul>
				<li>The	high radiation environment, which requires special design of computer
					components. This technology is well developed, but does add cost and
				  increases the bulk of components.</li>
				<li>The 290 K temperature swing between day and night. Two key things
				are important here:
					<ul>
						<li>Thermal wadis - which are masses of solid stone
				that store heat far better than the powdery soil. If a rover can
				snuggle up to one and throw a reflective tarp over itself to slow
				heat loss, the cold it has to withstand overnight is greatly reduced.
				</li>
					<li>Nuclear power - there is no reason to fear nuclear power on the
						Moon. It is a great way to get through the long cold night, when
						there is no solar power. Robots working at night can run their
						heaters by drawing power beamed to them as microwaves from the
						nuclear power plant
					</li>
				</ul> </li>
				<li>
				The extremely abrasive, finely
				powdered soil that will grind away at any moving part it gets into.
			</li>
			<li>
				The 3 second round-trip transmission delay between Earth and Moon,
				that will need to be designed for to make remote operation work.
			</li>
