When i started writing the timeline for Moonwards, a couple of weeks ago, i thought it would be three columns of bullet points that set up a rough outline, and then i'd leave it. I thought it would be a few thousand words. Now it is 130,000 words, and it swarms with activity, and inter-relationships, and knock-on effects, and i stopped before it sucked me in completely. It maps out how the whole society on the Moon works, how a very achievable set of technologies supports it, and how the colonies develop industry and agriculture.

What was most fun was thinking about how a society would form, and what it would be like. Moonwards sweeps aside political barriers in its paradigm to make it logical for a project on this scale to happen at all. The implications of that quickly set up Utopia - and that's okay. Resolving the conflicts that perpetuate suffering in the world depends mostly on creating a sense of brotherhood. The best way to do that is for people to work together to create something. The harder they work together, and the more inspirational the result is, the greater the sense of brotherhood afterwards. So the Moonwards path would indeed lead pretty far towards utopia; that is the underpinning of the entire project. Maybe some sweeping aside of political barriers would actually happen if people understood what we would be capable of as a result.

At any rate, the timeline uses a program where the space-faring nations unite to build the first installations that culminate in the transport infrastructure and construction capacity for spacious habitats. Then it sells residence in those habitats to nations to recoup the cost of that construction while acquiring a highly skilled and dedicated work force at the same time. For a price of US$300 million, any nation may send 2 astronauts to the Moon for the rest of their lives. Those astronauts must meet a list of stringent qualifications, including a strong background in science and engineering, and sign a contract for life to work for the International Space Agency in exchange for permanent residence on the Moon, in an environment that sustains all their needs. Over the course of 25 years, it recruits 25,400 astronauts in this way, with the cost of a spot in the program dropping by half while the number of spots doubles in each of 7 rounds. I shall leave it to you to go read how that many people are transported, lodged, and sustained in a way that would actually work. The point i want to make here is it strikes me as probable that people who live together that way for that much time will become quite adamant it is the way people ought to live.

Add to that the way they are socially organized and you get a lovely neotribal society. Because water is scarce, food and power limited, and everything must be recycled carefully, all through the Residence program the astronauts are split into groups of 30 to 50 who all share one large kitchen with one pantry, one set of showers, and one washing area for clothes and such. By the time the program ends, it has become a firmly established cultural preference to remain organized this way, and even to continue sharing kitchens and baths though the need disappeared long before. Administration and conflict resolution has become centered around these micro-communities. When people start having children, it becomes focused around these groups even more. We thus recover the strength in social bonds provided by a tribal society, while keeping all the strengths of a nation-state system based on technology. Snap! I rather adore it.

Once i return to working on the 3d models of the colony, i'll build a few examples of what i mean, about that kind of living situation. I think it will get across how well it can tap into our ancient instincts for those kinds of bonds and become second nature in no time. At a guess, i can start that in 2 months. Those are the fun jobs that make the work i have to do now in creating a strong framework for that more palatable.

Then there is the Space Boom... Yeah, that is what i put in the title, i almost forgot.
