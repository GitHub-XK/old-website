Test, test Let's say you have enough infrastructure on the Moon to fabricate
really good mirrors, small motors, and pivoting joints in bulk. And you make
10 km2 of mirrors and set them up outside so you can very accurately point them.
That's 12 GW of sunlight to throw around, accounting for some inefficiency in
the mirrors - if your target is at a small angle to the sun from the mirror's
position.
