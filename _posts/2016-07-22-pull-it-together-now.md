Ok. Must stop playing with digital models. No more time. The VMC layout i have looks kinda naked to me, compared to what is in my head. But the deadline looms.

So it will be a few hours still i think before things start appearing on the main site. I'm kinda punchy, and there's no time anyhow, so i'm going to slap a few 'under construction' signs around and just do the best i can.
