the recommendations in this Devtip video might
be a good organizational template:

Also convert to Jade, and create final versions of everything
that is in pure SASS and jade. Bourbon would indeed be
convenient, i just have to mess with it a bit in a test page,
then i can put it in the pages too.

Use Details and Summary Tags to nest material compactly, and use 
the Details-shim js to handle problems with IE.

Convert the menu to the 'mega-menu' format:

ERRORS AND GAPS TO FIX:
- The Sketchfab models need a better way to put captions
under them.

Incorporate rem for sizing
and get rid of px.

Incorporate media queries as part of
elements that need to be responsive but should stack below
a certain viewer width. Sass allows
media queries to be added as properties of a selector.


Make a really good page that people with incompatible
browsers are taken to, that sells the idea of upgrading,
and also explains why and has a link to a basic site
if they absolutely won't or can't.

Solve:
  Comment sections, in-house
  RSS feed generator - Jekyll looks like a good option
  Blog - Jekyll for that too
  Getting rid of Sketchfab - Three.js canvasses?
  YouTube channel - replace on the site with Vimeo?

Create reading list, codepens, and video that explains the
way the css and html works, so others can easily maintain
or add to it.

Check out Jade and see if the html should also be adapted.

Check out making Atom packages, hacking Atom, and Electron,
so we can essentially create a custom CMS for Moonwards.
