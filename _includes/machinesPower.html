				<h1>Power Infrastructure</h1>
				<p>
					Unless you go back to plans from the 70s, reference to
					nuclear power has completely disappeared from proposals
					for the Moon. This is unfortunate, as nuclear power is
					constant day and night, small modular plants are extremely
					simple to deploy, and safety is quite easy. At the poles,
					sunlight is nearly constant on certain mountain peaks,
					making solar power a good alternative to nuclear.
					Anywhere else,
					to set up a settlement you need nuclear power. Nuclear is
					a really good idea on the Moon. Here, it is used while
					the initial colony at Lalande, Cernan's Promise, gets
					going.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later on, once Cernan's Promise has developed the
					infrastructure, it can start extracting thorium from
					minerals in and around the crater and produce nuclear
					fuel on-site instead of importing it from Earth. But
					that wouldn't really be for power plants - it would be
					for nuclear rockets. Unless technology like Mach drives
					manages to produce high-thrust engines based on completely
					new science, nuclear engines will continue to be the
					best transport option between the surface of a celestial
					body and orbit. (Unless you've managed to build a space
					elevator... and not if the body has an atmosphere and
					someone lives there... there are a few wrinkles.)
