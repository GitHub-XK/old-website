				<h1>Extraction: Mining and Refining Elements and Compounds</h1>
				<p>
					The Moon has a marked tendency to either have lots of something, or none at all of something. Once we are able to really dig around there is reason to hope we will find some stuff there is no sign of on the surface. For the first years, it is prudent to assume what you have to work with is only what has been proven to be there. </p>
				<p>
					That list is adequate for a lot of things, but some ingenuity will be required to turn it into all we need for survival. Every way we process ore must be reinvented to suit the Moon. The chemicals most used in batch reactions to refine out certain products - acids and bases - are entirely absent from the Moon. If water and other volatiles were extracted from the poles in sufficient quantity, some of those chemicals could be made. That will take time and the resulting resources will be precious for much longer. The more water and nitrogen and carbon chemicals you use in materials processing, the less you have for farming and living spaces. It will likely be a long time before volatile mining can satisfy all local demands. Chemical catalysts can be imported from Earth and carefully recycled, but a bit will be lost in each batch and more will need to be imported regularly. Ways to use plentiful local resources to reduce reliance on these chemicals are important. </p>

					The <a href="http://lunarnetworks.blogspot.mx/2010/04/new-lunar-globe-as-seen-by-chandrayaan.html"> Moon Mineralogy Mapper</a> (M3) on the Chandrayaan-1 probe took images of most of the lunar surface in a set of 85 specific wavelengths in the visible to near-infrared range. This video takes different combinations of those wavelengths and combines them as red, green, and blue images to produce rainbow-colored results. Minerals can be identified by how much light they reflect in each of a set of wavelengths, so these colorful results reveal differences in the composition and state of the lunar surface. Much analysis of these results remains to be done. </div>

					Then there is the question of how you get the stuff out of the ground in the first place. The powder on the surface that can simply be scooped up is good enough for many things, with the designs adapted for that shown in these sections, including the dust roasters, MIP stations, and the collectors skimming the vapors off the TESS reservoir. For purer minerals, at Lalande Crater there is a wealth of rocks exposed on the surface, with a variety of compositions. Some are chunks of the bedrock that was blasted sky high during the impact that created Lalande. There are enough such rocks to supply reactors with good feedstock for quite some time, you just have to map and catalogue what kinds there are and haul the good ones a few kilometers to the refineries. But Peary Crater doesn't seem to have many rocks, as it is a far older part of the Moon. In such places fine-grain regolith has long since buried larger rock chunks, leaving them many meters under the surface. And anyways, there are more immediate reasons why you will want to make big, deep, steep-walled holes on the Moon than simply for mining. That's where you are going to put your habitats. </p>
				<p>
					Under the first 20 cm or so of powdery regolith (8 inches), the ground quickly becomes very hard packed. The individual particles of the soil look like shrapnel, because that is basically what they are - blast debris. Some of them are glass globules because they were from ground close enough to an impacting asteroid to be melted by it, and the molten spray of droplets cooled solid before they hit the ground, but it's largely shrapnel. That seems to be why the stuff clumps so well, it is all sort of gnarled together. So breaking it up isn't easy. </p>
				<p>
					Low gravity is another issue. If you could teleport an excavator to the Moon and run it, what would happen when you tried to dig with it, is it would tip over on its side. When everything weighs one-sixth as much, the force of the arm pushing the bucket into the ground is enough to lift the body. Just like with refining, excavation has to be done very differently. </p>
