				<h1>Extraction: from Ore to Product</h1>
				<p>The Moon has a marked tendency to either have lots of something, or none at all of something. Once we are able to really dig around there is reason to hope we will find some stuff there is no sign of on the surface. For the first years, it is prudent to assume what you have to work with is only what has been proven to be there.
				</p>
				<p>That list is adequate for a lot of things, but some ingenuity will be required to turn it into all we need for survival. Every way we process ore must be reinvented to suit the Moon. The chemicals most used in batch reactions to refine out certain products are entirely absent from the Moon. If water and other volatiles extracted from the poles (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) are used in chemical processing, that reduces the amount available for a range of other essential uses - fuel, life support and ecosystem development, and as ingredients of important materials. Production sufficient to satisfy local needs will take time, and they will remain precious for much longer. If alternate practices can be developed that reduce the need to use them in refining and chemicals production, supply can go to uses where there is no substitute.
				</p>
				<p>When chemicals are used on Earth to produce a specific product chemical in a batch reaction, other product(s) of the reaction are often allowed to dissipate or are thrown away because they have no value - substances like water and carbon dioxide. This would never be the case on the Moon, everything has to be collected and recycled as much as possible. If that is done efficiently, there are many cases where it would likely be preferable to periodically restock a key reactant from Earth than to use an alternative process that is more demanding.
				</p>
				<p> On the other hand, many reactions only happen above a certain temperature, or happen faster or differently above a certain temperature. A reactor that operates at very high temperatures reduces the need for reactants or allows a commonly available reactant (such as oxygen) to be used in place of an imported one (such as fluorine). Because the sun is strong and constant and heat dissipates slowly in a vacuum, high-temperature reactors are an attractive option for many things. The materials needed are expensive, but the resulting reactor lasts a long time.
				</p>
				<p>As the timeline progresses, some elements become much more plentiful. Not only is water mined in large volumes from the lunar poles, but also from asteroids brought into orbit. Later it is also mined from Ceres and Callisto. Processes that rely on water, or on hydrogen purified out of water, are more attractive as time progresses. This is also true of reactions involving carbon. Carbon chemicals will be mined from asteroids, and later come in from multiple other worlds more cheaply than it can be delivered from Earth. If carbon, hydrogen, or water can be very efficiently recycled and reused, it becomes worthwhile to use it, to a limited degree in Phase 2 and then much more in Phase 3 and beyond.
				</p>
				<p>Then there are techniques that produce chemicals using energy alone. In its simplest form, this can be simply a furnace that concentrates sunlight enough to melt a charge of regolith, which is then cooled and spun in a centrifuge so that certain minerals separate out. This is useful for production of glass. A step up from that, such a furnace that operates at a higher temperature can boil away a charge of regolith, and chilled collector plates can be positioned or inserted at the right time so that the deposits that build up on them are primarily of one metal oxide. More complex again, electrolysis done in a charge of molten regolith produces pure metals and oxygen that bubbles off. An alternative that produces similar results is the Schubert dust roaster, an approach too novel to summarize. Each approach has its pros and cons.
				</p>
				<p>Just as it would usually be preferable to build reactor vessels that operate at higher temperatures so they consume less reactant or use one that is more common, a furnace that uses purely sun to produce useful products is usually preferable to using any chemical reaction at all. This becomes more true as infrastructure accumulates allowing furnaces to be larger, and made more from local materials or materials that at least don't come from Earth. As the timeline progresses, the energy supply on the Moon also becomes bigger and bigger. Because most of the energy supply is derived from plentiful and reliable sunlight, the advantage of energy-based approaches increases with time. Even at the beginning of settlement, approaches that use chemical reactions can compete only where the reactants are plentiful, are nearly completely recycled, and use simpler, cheaper vessels and less energy. 
				</p>
				<p>An example of each of these approaches is examined following the chart.

					The <a href="http://lunarnetworks.blogspot.mx/2010/04/new-lunar-globe-as-seen-by-chandrayaan.html"> Moon Mineralogy Mapper</a> (M3) on the Chandrayaan-1 probe took images of most of the lunar surface in a set of 85 specific wavelengths in the visible to near-infrared range. This video takes different combinations of those wavelengths and combines them as red, green, and blue images to produce rainbow-colored results. Minerals can be identified by how much light they reflect in each of a set of wavelengths, so these colorful results reveal differences in the composition and state of the lunar surface. Much analysis of these results remains to be done. </div>

					Then there is the question of how you get the stuff out of the ground in the first place. The powder on the surface that can simply be scooped up is good enough for many things, with the designs adapted for that shown in these sections, including the dust roasters, MIP stations, and the collectors skimming the vapors off the TESS reservoir. For purer minerals, at Lalande Crater there is a wealth of rocks exposed on the surface, with a variety of compositions. Some are chunks of the bedrock that was blasted sky high during the impact that created Lalande. There are enough such rocks to supply reactors with good feedstock for quite some time, you just have to map and catalogue what kinds there are and haul the good ones a few kilometers to the refineries. But Peary Crater doesn't seem to have many rocks, as it is a far older part of the Moon. In such places fine-grain regolith has long since buried larger rock chunks, leaving them many meters under the surface. And anyways, there are more immediate reasons why you will want to make big, deep, steep-walled holes on the Moon than simply for mining. That's where you are going to put your habitats. </p>
				<p>
					Under the first 20 cm or so of powdery regolith (8 inches), the ground quickly becomes very hard packed. The individual particles of the soil look like shrapnel, because that is basically what they are - blast debris. Some of them are glass globules because they were from ground close enough to an impacting asteroid to be melted by it, and the molten spray of droplets cooled solid before they hit the ground, but it's largely shrapnel. That seems to be why the stuff clumps so well, it is all sort of gnarled together. So breaking it up isn't easy. </p>
				<p>
					Low gravity is another issue. If you could teleport an excavator to the Moon and run it, what would happen when you tried to dig with it, is it would tip over on its side. When everything weighs one-sixth as much, the force of the arm pushing the bucket into the ground is enough to lift the body. Just like with refining, excavation has to be done very differently. </p>
