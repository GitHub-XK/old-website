				<h3>Solar Photovoltaic Panels</h3>
        <p>The initial base at the north pole is powered by panels set up on talls masts. These masts can be placed in areas that already get sunlight on the surface over 80% of the time. By placing the solar panels 20 m up these masts, the proportion of the time they are in sun could be boosted to over 90% of the time. It's a matter of raising the panels above the few remaining prominences that block their view of the sun, as it skirts the horizon over the course of each lunar day. The panels then need only rotate once every 27.5 days to track the sun.
        </p>
        <p>Shadows are very long always at the pole. It is like being in a place where it is always almost sunset. To minimize power loss due to some solar panels being in the shadow of others at certain times, they need to be spread far apart and placed along a curved line following the crater rim, so only two ever line up at one time. Cables between the masts terminate in a set of microwave transmitters on the mast closest to the base. Mobile machinery gets power from those tranmitters, which send a tight beam of energy to the rectennas mounted on them. The early buildings also receive power through receivers, until cables can be laid.
        </p>
        <p>By the time the polar base becomes Inukshuk colony, the solar masts have been raised enough that all the panels are in the sun all the time, and the panels can be raised or lowered on their mast so the shadow of others never falls on them. It is easy enough to erect tall towers on the Moon, because the gravity is so low and there is never any wind or weather, that solar masts can be erected over a large area, and just made taller to put them always in the sun even if it takes several hundred meters before they are always above all shadows. This is important, as there are not only solar panel masts, but also solar mirrors reflecting light into greenhouses, and solar concentraters focussing sun to melt rock or perform other heat processes.
        </p>
        <p>Away from the poles, where there is sun only half the time, solar panels see limited use until Cernan's Promise is largely constructed. Once the initial setup of development in an area is complete, other energy formats are superior. This changes once flywheels can be manufactured in bulk from local materials. Then, during the day, the solar panels spin up the flywheels, storing energy as rotational energy.
