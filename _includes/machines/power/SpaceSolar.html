				<h3>Solar Power Beamed from Orbit</h3>
        <p>The orbits of the timeline's three vertical skyhooks in polar orbit around the Moon put their anchor stations in the sun at all times (short of an eclipse by Earth). The energy they collect can be beamed to the surface as microwaves with great efficiency.
