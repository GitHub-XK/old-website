				<h3>Excavation</h3>
				<p>The powder and fine-grained regolith on the surface that can simply be scooped up is good enough for many things, with the designs adapted for that shown in previous sections, including the MIP stations, STeMP units, solar furnaces, and MRE units.</p>
				<p> For purer minerals, at Lalande Crater there is a wealth of rocks exposed on the surface, with a variety of compositions. Some are chunks of the bedrock that was blasted sky high during the impact that created Lalande, and some of that bedrock may well have a composition that is advantageous for certain applications. For instance, some of it might be pure plagioclase, as mentioned in Glass Production. Hauling  the good rocks even 20 or 30 kilometers could well be worth it. What kinds there are around Lalande Crater will need to be mapped and catalogues.</p>
				<p>The north pole doesn't have many rocks, as it is a far older part of the Moon. In such places fine-grain regolith has long since buried larger rock chunks, leaving them many meters under the surface. That's okay - there are other why it's good to make big, deep, steep-walled holes on the Moon than simply besides mining. That's where you are going to put your habitats.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the first 20 cm or so of powdery regolith (8 inches), the ground quickly becomes very hard packed. The individual particles of the soil look like shrapnel, because that is basically what they are - blast debris. Some of them are glass globules originating from ground close enough to an impacting asteroid it was all instantly melted. The molten spray of droplets cooled solid before they hit the ground. The rest is shrapnel. That seems to be why the stuff clumps so well, the jagged, oddly shaped grains sort of gnarl together. So breaking it up isn't easy. </p>
				<p>
					Provisionally, the excavation for the habitats is planned to be done by blasting, just a teeny bit. The kind of blasting done in quarries on Earth wouldn't be safe unless all your machinery was moved quite a distance away. It would leave a lot of dust and debris to be cleaned up too. Since dust on moving parts is a serious problem on the Moon, you want to avoid anything that might lead to that. Instead, the idea is to bore holes into the ground, by running fiberoptic cables down the center of a tube, which carry concentrated sunlight. Then micro-charges of explosive are placed. When detonated, they are just enough to loosen the soil. They don't  throw anything into the non-existent air. </p>
				<p>
					It would take experimentation to find the depth and explosive energy needed for the right result. To give the soil somewhere to expand into, a trench needs to be dug around the grid of boreholes. That way the energy of the blasts can be released as movement to the the sides as well as movement upwards and compaction, resulting in loose soil. Boring by melting the ground with the sun is important. A conventional drill would heat up so fast in the vacuum and high-friction soil it would seize in no time. If that was overcome, there is an excellent chance dust would get into the moving parts and break them. </p>
				<p>
					Once the soil is broken up, a gantry crane like the one shown in the Construction section is used to clear the debris. To go deeper, a new trench is dug (or rather, mostly melted) and the process is repeated. If you reach bedrock, hopefully it will be composed of a useful mineral, or a strata not far down will be.
          <br><br>
					Boring and trenching becomes a different challenge at that point. Heat diffuses through solid rock many times faster than through the regolith. The sun gun won't be very effective any more. Quite possibly the thing to do then would be to clear the regolith from a large section of bedrock, cover the area well enough to fill the space with a very thin atmosphere, and switch to conventional drills and saws. </p>
				<p>
					When you need to do conventional digging, the machine will need to borrow mass from elsewhere by either being anchored to a cable set in something suitably immovable, or being loaded with ballast. </p>
