				<h3>Refining to get metals, oxygen, and metal oxides</h3>
				<p>
					The alternative to using chemicals for refining processes is using energy. It takes a lot of it and comes with challenges of its own. This is the approach taken by the dust roaster shown in the next section. This one device can do a lot. It produces a range of pure metals, pure oxygen, slag that makes good refractory materials, and a vapor byproduct that can be applied as a hard coating and sealant on objects placed at the machine's outlet. Because any kind of regolith that is put into a dust roaster comes out as 100% useful products, it is reasonable to calculate it outcompetes batch methods based on chemicals despite using a lot of energy to do so. By filling its hopper with extra-hot lava melted in the MIP stations or from solar thermal power plants, its power needs can also be considerably reduced. </p>
				<p>
					What the dust roaster can't provide is pure metal oxides. That is the unresolved issue that really hangs in the air. Building big and beautiful on the Moon takes a lot of glass, and making glass takes a very specific mix of metal oxides. There are a range of formulas for different kinds of glass, and they can stand a small amount of impurities. None of those formulas are close to the mineral composition of anything found on the Moon. Getting from what there is to what is needed requires either heating a suitable feedstock so hot for so long that most of it evaporates, or using an awuful lot of water and chemicals. The consistent, strong sun can easily do the heating with simple mirrors or lenses. The challenge is figuring out how to control that so specific substances can be collected, and the infrastructure can handle the heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, the process can be done in reverse - take pure metals and oxygen produced by the dust roaster, and combine them to produce metal oxides. That again requires a furnace, and mechanisms to properly mix the ingredients so they react completely, and then to shape them. It may be the most efficient method, if not in general than in certain cases. The process can be finely controlled which is a significant advantage, and heat is cheap as long as you get it by concentrating sunlight.

          Olivine - that's (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> - can be purified out of molten regolith by spinning it in centrifuge. To do that, heat it to the temperature where everything in it except the olivine is fully melted - around 1200&deg;C. On Earth, deposits of magma that sit at that temperature for a while often form a layer of olivine at the bottom because the crystals settle out. On the Moon, the gravity may be too low for that, at least in a timely fashion, so you help it along by spinning the melt fast enough that a force equivalent to several gravities push the heavy crystals to the outside of their vessel. Shall we say 10 g's of force? Right now, i favor spinning a flat, disk-shaped vessel to perform this process. The olivine would gather at the rim of the vessel, and the rest would stay towards the middle. Now you chill the vessel to around 1100&deg;C so the whole thing hardens. Unclamp the top half of the vessel from the bottom half, pop out the hot stone, and cut the olivine part off. By lining the vessel with graphite, the stone will pop out easily. The vessel would be sort of like a flat burger, with the stone being the patty and the two halves of the mold being the buns.

          The east wall of Lalande Crater is probably highlands material in parts. If you get to the bedrock in that area you might find dunite, or digging in the nearby hills might uncover that. Dunite is at least 90% olivine. Doing the above process with that feedstock would have much better yield - really, you would be removing 'impurities' of aluminium, calcium, and traces of other stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have pure olivine, you melt it and centrifuge it again. This time you are separating the two minerals that make up olivine: forsterite (which is Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub> from fayalite (Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub>). The fayalite will melt first, when the stone is again above 1200&deg;C. The magnesium silicate will remain crystalline, and as it is less dense, in the centrifuge it will gather in the middle of the disk while the iron silicate is concentrated at the edge. It could be from a third to a half of the mix. Cool the mould again so everything is solid, pop out the stone, and cut the iron silicate away from the magnesium silicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, why do this... Well, it all depends on how well the fayalite reacts with hydrogen.
          If the fayalite is put in a fluidized bed reactor, melted once more, and hydrogen is bubbled through it, a reaction occurs in which oxygen preferentially bonds with hydrogen over iron. This needs a much higher temperature of at least 1700&deg;C so that everything stays molten as the reaction proceeds. If the mix is all reacted this way, the yield is water, iron, and silica. That would be pretty great. However, if more than maybe 2% of the iron can't be removed, there is really no point. That is what is needed so that the silica can be turned into decently clear glass. Either this is a promising option to produce bulk glass, or it is a dead end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The architecture in these colonies uses a great deal of glass. If you can't go outside, you have to have plenty of big windows. Thus there is a need to answer the question of how that glass is made in order for the colonies to be realistic. How to supply materials for everything else is sufficiently answered for our needs here. Glass is still an open question.

The model notes go through each stage of processing. Production was estimated in <a href="http://enu.kz/repository/2010/AIAA-2010-8703.pdf">the AIAA paper</a> to be 20 metric tons of silicon per year. If the efficiency for other metals is similar, that means about 10 tons of aluminum, 8 tons of iron, and a ton or so of titanium, considering the average proportion of metals in the regolith of the maria. Output of a desired metal can be increased by selecting better feedstock or pre-processing it with other methods before putting it in the dust roaster. The paper postulated power needs of about 200 kW. If processing targets one or more specific metals, power needs could go up or down.

This reactor uses the heat of the sunlight concentrated in the mirrors to melt the regolith loaded into the silo. Then hydrogen is bubbled through the mix. The reaction of hydrogen with the molten mix produces water and free metals. This model looks at processing ilmenite this way, but the process can be applied to many other mixtures. The hotter the contents can be made, the more can be done here. Pre-processing elsewhere can also make this unit more versatile. For instance, if fayalite can be sufficiently purified out of olivine, this reactor could be used to produce silica. The silica is then used to make glass, or panels of quartz. Even if the product is discolored by impurities, a bulk process like that would be invaluable.
