      <h3>Schubert Dust Roaster</h3>
      <p>This apparatus needs much more development than molten regolith electrolysis to attain a working prototype. It is solidly founded on a set of methods that have each been applied successfully for purposes similar to the part they play in it, but they have never been used together, and certainly not to do something so challenging. It's novel enough that probably a large set of prototypes would need to be built and tested in order to design a good working model. Because local gravity and ambient pressure have a big effect on testing this device, it's the sort of thing that might only see development once we have the facilities on the Moon to do that.
     </p>
     <p>This device produces a range of pure metals, pure oxygen, and slag that makes good refractory materials. It is superior to MRE in certain respects. The metals it produces collect separately as pure elements, not as a molten puddle of mixed metals. It doesn't require rare, expensive iridium. It's unlikely to be nearly as energy efficient, though. The system is also more complex and would seem to require more maintenance, at the least to remove deposits that build up on the walls. If it performs better in durability and reliability, it could be the better option if energy is plentiful enough that the lower efficiency is not a concern. When considering efficiency, the energy needed to turn the metal alloy produced in the MRE units into pure metals or useful alloys would have to be included, which could make the two systems a lot more comparable in total energy consumption for a given product.
     </p>
     <p>The designs in the linked documents are for a unit delivered from Earth that must work after landing with minimal setup or maintenance. Units manufactured on the Moon have no need to consider payload mass and can be designed to get ongoing maintenance. The top operating temperature in that case can be higher than the 2700&deg;C upper limit in these designs. Locally made dust roasters portrayed in the colonies will be much more massive. All the structural pieces will be thick enough to account for tubing running through them, carrying coolant. They will all have liners so during maintenance, the unit can be opened up, the liners replaced, and the deposits on the old liners be chipped or ground off. If cooled properly, that allows a unit to draw more power and super-heat the plasma stream above the dissociation energy of all the component metal oxides. Every metal in the regolith could be refined out, even calcium and magnesium. Since the unit is designed to act on the molten stream and condensed globules that never touch the device's walls, the proper modicum of cooling won't affect output.

The model notes go through each stage of processing. The portrayed unit is based on <a href="http://enu.kz/repository/2010/AIAA-2010-8703.pdf">this AIAA paper</a>. It is estimated to draw 200 kW of power to produce 17 metric tons of silicon per year, plus a quantity of aluminum and iron. Units made on the Moon would have different dimensions. In particular, the structural parts would all be thicker and heavier, and include systems to actively cool them.
