      <h3>Glass Production</h3>
      <p>Clear glass can have a wide range of chemistries. The glass used in windows on Earth is soda-lime glass, and is composed mostly of silicon dioxide and sodium oxide. Pure silica sand, composed almost entirely of silicon dioxide, is common on Earth. The Moon has nothing like that. The proportion of silica in the minerals of the regolith is never more than half.
     </p>
     <p>Most of the metal oxides in the regolith will form clear glass if melted and then properly cooled to form a solid without a crystal structure, which is technically what glass is. The oxides of aluminum, magnesiium, calcium, and sodium will all do this just like silica does. Those metal oxides form 80 to 90 percent of the volume of most lunar minerals. Working with glass that is high in metal oxides other than silica can be more difficult - it could require higher heating and the glass may only be workable over a narrower temperature range.</p>
     <p>A solar glass furnace would have little problem attaining higher temperatures but more consideration would need to be given to the materials used in the equipment. The vacuum also makes it easier to work with glass that has a narrow working temperature range. Rather than having to reheat glass to anneal it (to relieve internal stresses that weaken the glass), the glass must be cooled enough to have the desired viscosity to be put through rollers that extrude it as flat sheets. Sheet glass that is flat, or even better that has a curve to it, is what is really needed in giant quantities for many of the structures in the colonies. Radiators that gently chill the rollers can be used to put the glass at the right temperature to be properly formed, after which, if needed, a bit of sun can ensure it cools just slowly enough to have good strength.
     </p>
     <p>However, the 10 to 20 percent of the regolith mineral mix that isn't oxides of silicon, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and sodium, must be removed almost completely or the glass will be strongly tinted or opaque. Iron turns it blue-green, titanium and sulfur yellow-brown, manganese purple, chromium dark green, and all of these are common enough in the regolith to have a strong effect. And there are a long list of others, some of which will discolor strongly at very low concentrations. Cobalt will yield blue glass at concentrations of 250 ppm.
     </p>
     <p>Finding a deposit of highlands regolith that is very low in the undesired metals is the first thing to do. This shouldn't be too hard, and results could be much better if material can be obtained from rock instead of fine-grained regolith. Some highlands regolith is almost entirely plagioclase, so possibly the bedrock it came from is pure plagioclase. Plagioclase has none of the metals that are problematic, it's composed purely of oxides of light metals - aluminum, calcium, sodium, and silicon. If particles containing iron can be removed with magnets from powder plagioclase regolith, the remainder might be pure enough to make decently clear glass. The titanium is all in ilmenite, which also contains iron so would be removed by the magnetic separation. That might be enough.</p>
     <p>Something of a tint to windows is vastly preferable to not having windows, and the lunar landscape is so colorless a tint to it could be regarded as an improvement. If glass could be produced in industrial quantities with the above process, which is fairly low-energy and low-tech, it would be pursued early on even if the resulting glass had a pretty clear tinge to it. There are also other options.
     </p>
     <p>The process of purifying olivine and pyroxene mentioned above in the solar furnace section could be applied to making clear glass. All of the minerals most common in the regolith that cause tinting fit into the crystal structure of pyroxene. The liquid poured off after pyroxene crystals have been pressed to the bottom of a vessel in a centrifuge will be made almost completely of oxides of silicon, aluminum, calcium, and sodium. The remaining minor components aren't problematic - oxides of phosphorus and potassium, which are used in making glass on Earth and don't affect transparency.
     </p>
     <p>As long as the regolith was toasted for a good while before being melted to remove its volatiles, this process as well could provide decently clear glass. The toasting especially needs to remove the sulfur, which otherwise will color glass yellow. This process is also technically simple. It requires more energy to perform, but mostly as heat which can be obtained from the sun, essentially for free once the equipment exists.
     </p>
     <p>If purification by centrifuge worked well enough, any regolith feedstock could be used for this process. If it didn't work well enough the first time, repeating it could result in the purity required. Or, once again, selecting regolith from the highlands with a low content of troublesome minerals to begin with could yield a product good for clear glass after the first time through the centrifuge. Or, a centrifuge that presses the molten regolith with greater force could increase purity sufficiently. After all, centrifuges are another thing the Moon is very kind to - no atmospheric drag on the spinning vessels, and making frictionless magnetic bearings is a lot easier in the low gravity. Centrifuges benefit from this the same way flywheels do.
