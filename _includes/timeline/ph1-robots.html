<p>Each of the 2 LNCs delivers equipment to the base site on the west rim of Hinshelwood crater, each returning once to the Pod Ship to land it all. They land 80 tons of robots, equipment, and supplies, and enough water for the hydrolysis pod to produce the fuel needed for them to make it back to orbit. The robots, operated from Earth and then from orbit, deploy the solar power systems, a hangar for lab work and long-term maintenance and repair, scout, test lots of equipment including for water mining, excavation, and construction, and do a bunch of 'paving' (fusing of the powdery surface into a solid layer). </p>
<details>
<summary>Initial tasks done by robots</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up tall masts for solar panels and microwave power transmitters, cables and power management equipment, and radiator units.</li>
    <li>A half-pipe shaped hangar is set up on ground that has been roughly leveled and paved. It is an unpressurized shell with a various snap-together units inside, creating a maintenance and repair hangar for the robots and their tools, and a lab area. All the equipment for these tasks in installed in the prefab bays designed for them. </li>
    <li>One of the cargo pods lowered from a LNC is a self-contained unit for converting water to liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. It only needs power from the solar masts or the LNC reactors, and its custom radiator units deployed. It lands with a full water tank.</li>
    <li>A rover using simple mirrors and Fresnel lenses fuses surface regolith around the site. The thin layer created will tend to break up and shift, but by driving a grid of fused regolith stakes into the ground before passing the lens over an area, the melted surface fuses with the stakes into one piece. Cracking then doesn't lead to shifting. Thickening the fused layer by spreading more regolith overtop and heating it is done in areas that call for it, such as the LNC landing pads. </li>
    <li>These simple stakes and perhaps one or two other simple shapes are produced in graphite molds filled with molten regolith produced with a parabolic mirror setup.</li>
    <li> Experimentation is done with making useful shapes by cast-in-place methods after pressing shapes into the powder regolith, and by scanning concentrated sunlight over a bed of powder regolith.</li>
    <li>Potential ice mining sites are scouted and surveyed. A large area is surveyed with ground-penetrating radar and seismic sensors, both within Hinshelwood Crater, and in surrounding depressions. Many cores are drilled out and taken for analysis in the lab.</li>
    <li>Prototype equipment for ice mining is tested in shallow depressions that don't reach the unEarthly cold of the large northern craters, which are far more challenging environments and of much greater scientific interest.</li>
    <li> A unit for boring deep holes is tested in a sunlit area. In the holes bored, small charges are laid and excavation by blasting is tested - far from everything else, and on a small scale. </li>
    <li>The wells for the LNC nuclear engines are blasted out and prepped. </li>
    <li>The LNCs conduct sortie missions scouting places of interest on the Moon and returning samples for testing in the lab.</li>
  </ul>

<h5>Crew Sortie Mission and Robot Expansion</h5>
<p>An initial inflatable hab for crew sorties that looks a lot like a Quonset hut (based on upcoming design by Benaroya et al.) is delivered and set up prior to the arrival of a crew of 4 that stays for 2 weeks. The LNCs deliver a further 100 tons of materials and supplies in  support of the crew and accompanying mission goals. </p>
<p>Their work makes the robots about as agile and precise as people. They test and deploy the new equipment that arrived before their mission. Much of that equipment is prototype water mining robots. By the time they leave, the robots on the base are as capable as a permanent crew of around 30 people. They are assisted in their work by the crew on Crossroads Station, who do the remote operation of the robots.</p>

<details>
<summary>How the Crews Augment the Robots</summary>
<ul>
<li>They set up infrastructure that enhances the precision of the robots dramatically: rails, grids of sensors and signals, monitoring cameras. These are placed with precision the robots were not capable of on their own.</li>
<li>They do any repairs that were beyond the abilities of the remotely operated repair bays, which mostly used drop-in replacement parts. They install and test equipment to give those repair bays abilities comparable to a human with a full workshop. </li>
<li>They deploy and test the next generation of robots, designed based on experience with the first generation. They do final assembly and calibration before putting them through their paces in a way that efficiently collects data for design of the 3rd generation.</li>
<li>They especially focus on deploying and testing several prototype water mining units, assessing them and adjusting them in a series of trials. This information is used to deploy the first generation of truly industrial equipment, after which water production becomes a real business.</li>
<li>They set up the guides and markers showing the robots where to excavate for the first permanent hab, and the production units for the construction materials that hab will be made of. They ensure the products from those stations meet quality standards and the construction robots are performing up to spec. Once satisfied, they give the green light for construction to commence.</li>
</ul>

<h5><a href="https://moonwards.com/colonies.html#PolarFirstHab">Construction of First Hab at the Polar Base</a></h5>
<p>This habitat is the first instance of the robots doing <a class="https://www.moonwards.com/machines.html#building">truly complex work</a>. It isn't possible until the crew on Crossroads is able to control them finely, and count on them to execute a lot of complex behaviour with little to no direction (such as maintaining their balance, picking things up, throwing and catching things).</p>
<p>It also requires excavating a cube 30 m on a side, and mass production of simple construction materials with consistent quality (though that quality doesn't have to be high). The outer walls and internal floors, walls and furnishings are made with local materials. </p>
<p>Everything else is shipped in, but it takes only one Pod Ship payload to deliver it all. Large items include a second inflatable hab with an extra large airlock, the tubes and mirrors of the light funnels, the multi-layer transparent membrane roof and its reinforcing cables, several very large high-resolution computer screens, and a radiator unit.</p>
<p>If assistance from the crew at Crossroads is required, they can fly in for a week at a time and stay in the inflatable hab. The aim would be very much to avoid that, perhaps there might be one or two such trips.</p>

<h5>Water Production</h5>
<p>Once a successful approach to ice mining is found, 200 tons of equipment is brought in to do just that. Initial caution to preserve the permanently shadowed regions for research is abandoned in Hinshelwood Crater and Hermite A Crater. They become ice mines. This opens the possibility of using techniques that are much more disruptive, but get ever more efficient with scale. One possibility is covering a large area with a strong membrane and sealing it to the ground, putting a heater in the center of it, and pumping off any gases released by the heat.
</p>
<p>With this industrial approach and the cargo capacity of the transport system, water production ramps up very quickly. Accompanying production of carbon dioxide, ammonia, and several trace gases is also significant for lunar development. Production exceeds 10 kilotons per year within 5 years, if reserves are at the low end of predictions.</p>
<p>This means that all the fuel for the Pod Ships, the LNCs, and other spacecraft fueling at the EESS then comes from the Moon. </p>
