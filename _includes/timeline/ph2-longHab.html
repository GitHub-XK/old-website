 <summary><h5>Long Hab</h5></summary>
 <p>Long Hab is a long, deep habitat with a vaulted roof. Like all habs in this mission architecture, it has plenty of natural light and big outdoor views. Its views are achieved with mirrors and lenses, so that radiation is kept low and the structural challenges of large windows are avoided. </p>
 <p>Enough equipment, crew, and knowledge have built up for Long Hab to be a big step up from First Hab. It is 200 m long, 30 m wide, with variable depth of 30 to 50 m from the floor to where the walls meet the roof, and the vaulted ceiling is 15 m high. </p>
 <p>Tele-operation of the robots building Long Hab is done by the crew of First Hab with support by the crew of Crossroads. Little tele-operation is done from Earth for construction. It is also uncommon for astronauts to work outside on construction, instead they do most things remotely through the robots. When they go out, they put pressurized cabs on the rovers and wear only flight suits, not proper space suits. Space suits are very restrictive, uncomfortable, and clumsy, they are used only when necessary (and occasionally just to go for a walk outside).</p>

   <summary>Construction Process</summary>
   <ul>
 <li>In-situ construction materials and techniques have developed enough that nothing structural is brought from Earth for Long Hab, and even some systems installations are made of local materials.</li>
 <li>Excavation methods have matured enough that vertical walls of great height, deep undercuts, and tunnels of 50 or 60 meters are not a problem.
   <ul>
     <li>Blasting is used to make shaped pits and channels, the sides of which are then built up by back-filling behind walls, or pared down with heat-based cutting methods. The colony now has many such tools on a range of scales. </li>
     <li>Ripper and jack-hammer attachments on the arms of heavy-duty construction rovers still do rough shaping of recesses and undercuts. After that, specialized liquid-cooled saw blades and drill bits allow cuts to be made and holes to be drilled. Heat from friction would build up in the vacuum environment and make blades and bits seize if they weren't cooled. The bulk of the cooling systems make the them thick, they can't cut or drill anything narrower than 3 cm across. </li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>The arches that form the vaulted roof are made of blocks from the first full MIP stations - melt-in-place stations, that evolved from earlier processes of that kind. There are also now many graphite molds, and molten regolith is produced in bulk for them, and for pouring into forms for large pieces. The roof is reinforced with basalt fiber cables from new production facilities making basalt fiber products on-site. Good basalt feedstock for the process is brought by LNCs returning from sorties where they had access to it.

   <summary>Hab Architecture</summary>
   <p>The astronauts don't get to spend much time outside, and they are never truly outside. When on the open surface they are surrounded by beautiful desolation that can't fill in for the outdoors on Earth. Their indoors has to come as close as possible to being their outdoors too. This is one reason why it is so important to make the habs as huge as possible from the outset. It is a matter of emotional health, a matter that becomes more important with each passing month.</p>
   <p>The habs are also all huge because many things about regulating an environment in space become easier with size: thermal regulation, air recycling, air quality, noise control, and everything having to do with creating and balancing an ecosystem, from mould not instantly growing on every dirty surface to there simply being enough space for a complex set of organisms to coexist in something resembling harmony.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the materials the habs are built from, and the way they are melded together, surfaces are never quite straight or flat and corners are soft. Once the molten regolith parged over the walls and cielings has cooled into a single glassy surface, it will naturally have variations in tone and texture, and many simple things can help that along to accentuate the richness of the final patina. Not only is the building technique the best way to make use of the local materials, it is the best way to create a space that feels like you are in nature, though you aren't. This will be important to the residents.</p>

     <summary>Main Features</summary>
     <ul>
       <li><b>Light tubes terminating in lenses</b> - similar to the light tubes shown on the initial model of First Hab, these tubes funnel in a large amount of sun, and can do so most of the time at Inukshuk's location. In this version, the lens at the mouth inside the hab disperses the sun over a wide enough area for it to have the intensity of sun near sunset, with the spectrum of sun at noon. </li>
       <li><b>Sky-like sections</b> - A thin layer of molten aluminum is spattered over these sections of the vaulted ceiling, leaving a surface that creates scattered, mottled reflections. This creates a sense of space above and distributes light more evenly. This is done in the sections with the light tubes, of which there are three along the length of the hab, interspersed with sections that feel more like buildings, as does either end of the hab.</li>
       <li><b>Gardens</b> - The work that has been done at the EESS on beneficiating the regolith into fertile soil has had success. The EESS sends back a couple of tons of the stuff and the recipe for making it. In place of organic matter to fluff it into something that is properly aerated, they mix in the basalt fibers they have been making, chopped to the right length. This soil is placed in several long, narrow beds, where the crew plant a variety of test plants, including a few bushes. In a while they manage to create a few tons more and create several more gardens, and a little patch of grass. There are many hydroponic plant beds too. As it is the soil beds that are the key to creating a true ecosystem and that give the feeling of the presence of nature, they are a lot more special.</li>
       <li><b>Pond</b> - The pool water (see Health, below) is pumped to a pond in one of the sky sections, that is planted with a range of aquatic plants. It is important for ecosystem creation to figure out how to purify water with natural processes. It takes a while before the crew manages to get the pond environment going. For a long time the pool water is mostly purified with filters and ultraviolet light disinfection systems. Slowly the pond becomes healthy and takes over the job. </li>
       <li><b>Lunar parkour</b> - The exertion of normal activities on Earth is absent on the Moon, if they are done in the same way. Designing the hab interior to take account of this allows residents to move in a way that is more efficient, more engaging, and healthier. Instead of stairs, tubes are used to move between floors, where you grab the sides and haul yourself up. With practise, residents learn to do this so fast it is a sort of vertical running. People often jump between floors as well. It becomes a passtime to find new and exciting ways to move around the habs by bouncing off walls, swinging from things, and jumping great distances. Things are placed to create opportunities for this. Each level of the hab is also high, 4 to 5 m, to give people headroom even though a normal moon walk has a pretty high bounce in it.</li>

       <summary>Health Facilities</summary>
       <ul>
       <li><b>Swimming Pool</b> - With the ice mines producing lots of water, this is a full olympic sized pool with a deep end deep enough for high-diving. Swimming is an important conditioning exercise for residents - it loads their muscles in a way that is hard to achieve outside the water, making them work as hard as they have to on Earth to do the same thing, a consistent load that can be gentle or quite demanding. It is a central part of their cardio and muscle-building routines.</li>
       <li><b>Manual centrifuge</b> - this looks sort of like a wide bicycle wheel on its side whose axle is connected to a platform where people spin the wheel using pure muscle power. It takes a while to get going but can then be maintained fairly easily at an RPM that imitates 1 gravity of force for the people on the rim of the wheel. Spending time frequently in this simulated gravity is important for the health of the residents, for their circulatory systems, and fluid distribution in their bodies, and the health of their bones. Exercise is done while on the wheel to maximize benefit. The exercise of pushing the wheel is also beneficial. A motor can also be used to turn the wheel, but people sometimes find it enjoyable to do it by hand. It was designed that way to have a social element.</li>
       <li><b>Lunar gym</b> - The gym area is the full height of Long Hab's tallest section, 50 m. Its floor is so heavily padded that even if someone jumps from the very top if it, they will land unharmed. The foam used is stiff enough that in the low gravity it can be walked over fairly normally, but yeilds sufficiently to absorb the energy of a jump from 50 m. Sections of the floor are trampolines, for rebounding back up over that distance. The padded walls are covered with small ledges and recesses for hand and foot holds. There are a bunch of ropes and nets hanging from ceiling to floor. The reason for all this is that in lunar gravity to get a decent workout, and to load as many bones and muscles as possible, the thing to do is climb. To put your skeleton through the forces it handles on Earth, the best thing is to jump high. It's also pretty fun to be able to jump up and down from so high safely. The residents quickly start inventing vertically oriented sports and games.</li>
