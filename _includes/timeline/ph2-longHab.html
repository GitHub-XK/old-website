 <h5>Research into Basic Industry</h5>
 <ul>
  <li><h6>Fused Regolith Objects</h6>The simple boards, beams, rods and such that the MIP stations can produce are sufficient for the bulk of this hab, without needing cables or fiber reinforcement. They can also be used to produce simple furnishings (tables, shelves, doors, chairs, beds...) and simple implements (jugs, cups, bowls, boxes, shovels, rakes...) </li>
  <li><h6>Imported Objects</h6> - the roof membrane, life support systems, plumbing and wiring, lights, appliances, and more come from Earth and are installed. 3d printers using metal powder have already been successfully used to create certain parts for the robots, and can reduce what must be shipped from Earth a little, but mostly just by reducing the number of replacement parts sent along.  </li>
  <li><h6>Crew of 30 Arrive on 2 Year Mission</h6>Once the hab has been pressurized and all the systems successfully tested, they arrive. At the end of the initial mission they may be rotated out for other people, but the staff remains 30 people. From the outset, this crew is selected based on the psychological philosophy the Residence Program will also follow: they are all couples married at least 10 years, over 40, with no children under 18. As anticipated, most of the original crew chooses to stay on the Moon permanently.</li>
  <li><h6>Development of industrial and farming processes</h6> is their mission. They are able to accomplish a great deal quickly, because operators on Earth continue to  teleoperate the existing equipment. They operate robots remotely from within the hab or a rover with a pressurized cab, or bring things into the hab to work on them. Doing manual labor outside in a spacesuit is avoided because it is clumsy. They are rapidly able to innovate.</li>
  <li>Once they complete the first greenhouse and fill it with healthy plants, greatly increase production of water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, complete the first solar thermal power plant, add a second, much larger hab using an expanded range of local products, and meet a set of test goals demonstrating that it is safe to expand the population, the Residence Program begins</li>
  <li><h6>Inukshuk Base is Declared a Permanent Settlement</h6>Due to the great significance of the first permanent habitat on another celestial body, the first completed hab is simply called First Hab. The second hab becomes known as Long Hab because it is long and narrow.</li>
 </ul>

 <p><h6>Perfect Place for a Great Telescope</h6> Easy servicing, power and data trasmission provided by existing station infrastructure, mass of the telescope not an issue, aiming and tracking of the scope very easy (though elaborate measures have to be taken to isolate it from vibrations and oscillations due to other activity on the skyhook). The anchor makes an excellent home for a really awesome telescope. For this reason it is named for Carl Sagan, an astronomer who dreamed of space settlement and is a figurehead of the movement. </p>
 <p>Nothing else is planned for this skyhook - activities will occur at Gagarin Station on the equatorial skyhook once it is built. All that needs to happen at Sagan, is that its mass be replaced with bulk regolith and fused regolith structures so its valuable minerals can be extracted at Inukshuk, and it needs to berth the pod ship every two weeks while payload transfers occur, and mechanisms on it need to keep the skyhook's orbit in good shape.</p>
 <p>Once Gagarin is commissioned, the pod ship will berth there instead. Shuttles will continue to use Sagan's skyhook for travel around the Moon, but will no longer send payload up the tether. Instead, they will take payloads to Lalande, and from there they will be sent up Gagarin's skyhook. Once all the useful minerals in Sagan's asteroid are used up, things will be pretty peaceful there. The telescope can be spread out, given multiple mirrors and fancy shades to protect it from heat and radiation. Once it is no longer needed for transport to and from the surface, the telescope's needs dictate development on that skyhook.</p>
