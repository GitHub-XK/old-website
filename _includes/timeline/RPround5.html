    <h5>Addition of 3 More Polar Skyhooks</h5>
    <p>The original asteroid retrieval ship, now heavily upgraded, delivers asteroids for the remaining skyhooks for the Moon. They are placed in staggered polar orbits, one every 90&deg;, and all the skyhooks have the same orbital period so they will never interfere with each other. All three mass 25 kilotons, like the Gagarin asteroid. One is again carbonaceous, the other two are mostly metal. They are developed into skyhooks like Sagan, minus the telescope and with less living volume. Mining equipment goes to all three, but there is little call for human habitation on them and they have only basic facilities for a small, occasional crew. The mining and transport work is overseen remotely and is largely automatic. </p>
    <p><h6>Lunar Transport Network Spreads Development</h6>With this system complete, the maximum wait between convenient trajectories to or from a skyhook is 3.5 days anywhere on the Moon. With a reasonable fuel penalty, most places are accessible much more regularly. In a pinch a rescue crew can get anywhere in a few hours using the shuttles alone. So, now ice mining starts at the south pole as well, and many other places on the Moon are explored more extensively. In a few places, valuable ores, or very large lava tubes, or some especially exciting discovery is found, and expeditions begin development or exploration there.</p>
    <h5>Coil Gun Use Begins</h5>
    <p>Cernan's Promise starts using coil guns to launch cargo to the foot of Gagarin, or straight into orbit or on a trajectory for LEO. These launches are in capsules that have thrusters sufficient for course corrections or orbital maneuvers, and most are reusable. Some can also be decelerated by a catcher with a similar structure on return, that system is made after the initial coil gun.</p>
    <p><h6>Lalande B</h6>, at 8 km across and about 30 km north of Lalande, is used for this purpose. All spaceport activity is transferred there over time to provide a buffer zone between it and Lalande City. It also has  an even shape and smooth walls so the coil guns over time can be made longer, and to swivel on a track around the crater rim in order to launch or catch in any direction.</p>
    <h5><a href="machines2.html#EarthTether">Earth Orbital Skyhook Work Begins</a></h5>
    <p>Another jump up in mass moved, the asteroid delivered to be the anchor mass is 200 kilotons of material, largely metallic. Its orbit is circularized at 10,000 km altitude, and a tether is built earthwards to an altitude of 250 km. At first the tether is only sufficient for berthing of a small ship at the foot platform, of 10 tons. </p>
    <p>This is sufficient for transport of the Round 5 astronauts. Reusable rockets optimized for the delta V needed to reach the foot platform are used to get them there. With these rockets, launch costs do indeed drop to a tiny fraction of what they were before.</p>

    <h5>Structures Filled In and Capacity Increased</h5>
    <p><h6>Creating a Homey Feel</h6>While all the structures of Cernan's Promise and Inukshuk now exist, they are only slowly filling up. They were designed to be blank canvasses that fill in organically over time. As the population expands, they build their homes within these spaces. Each arriving group is given temporary lodging, and asked to split themselves into groups of 30 people. Each group is given an area surrounding a basic set of facilites - a cold pantry, a set of sinks, appliances, and showers, gear for a good number of distributed electrical outlets, charging stations, lights, taps, and drains. They are given guidelines on floorspace allotment, but are permitted to combine or trade space within some limits. They are able to use the MIP stations, 3d printers, and other gear to have custom houses made and assembled. As there is no need to install plumbing or any weather protection in their homes, the gravity is so low, and prefab electrical stuff can be easily clipped onto things, the design options for the homes are wide open.</p>
    <p><h6>Organization Around Shared Kitchen and Bath</h6> The kitchens, baths, and washing areas each group sets up for their homes are very personalized and identified with each group. (Toilets are the only such amenity not shared - Each apartment gets a waterless composting toilet and a small sink that runs from a water tank. The toilets don't smell and their products are needed in the gardens.) In this process each group forges a group identity and come to feel they are at home. Their creations feel like mini-spas and picnic spots. Some people choose to pool the floorspaces assigned to them to build more elaborate, larger shared houses. Groups can take in more members if they wish, but the practical limit on the number of people who can comfortably share the resources they are given is about 50. Where personalities don't mesh, spaces are exchanged and people join a different group, sometimes then deciding to alter their houses. The cost of this is minimal as the equipment is there and not fully occupied, and the structures are easily altered.</p>
    <p><h6>Local Ecosystem</h6>The atriums, Teacup, and the polar greenhouses are filled with plants. The crops yielded incease in quality, quantity, and variety as knowledge is gained and resources increase. The colonies near food independence. Some animals now range free in small numbers within garden areas, including select flying insects, small lizards, and birds. </p>
    <p><h6>Becoming a Town</h6>The colonists decide upon and build all the shared facilities they need or enjoy. Office space, workshops, gardens, forums, sports arenas, gathering spots, exercise facilities, event areas, chapels and churches, display areas, meeting rooms, and anything else that isn't included in official construction. There are general guidelines for the things the colonists build but they have a lot of leeway. The official things include medical and safety facilities, storage areas for food and all sorts of supplies, administrative offices, and everything to do with transport or industry. These things are built according to official plans or regulatory standards.</p>
    <p>The hangars are filled in with machinery and a variety of products are developed. A wider variety of components are produced for shipment into space. A larger proportion of the robots and machines that do this are produced on site. Quartz glass, basalt composites, mirrors, basalt cloth and cable, and fiberoptics are produced in bulk. Metal objects of iron, magnesium, nickel, and cobalt are stamped, extruded, or made in molds in significant quantities. Specialized items in a variety of metals are 3d printed. </p>
    <p>The spaceport is moved mostly to Lalande B and its capacity is ramped up as fast as possible. </p>

    <h5>With Greater Resident Freedom, A Unique Culture Begins to Form</h5>
    <p><h6>Economic Approaches</h6>For the first time, more than half of colonists' work time is not devoted to duties assigned by the Moon Agency. Some duties that were previously under its auspices are now done by private businesses. Colonists who performed those duties can now choose whether they want to continue them in exchange for pay or a share of profits with the companies now in charge, set up their own businesses in these areas, or branch out into something else. Because the needs of life will always be free, of the colonists who don't sign up with the companies created by privatization, there is a fairly even split between those who choose a non-commercial approach in the work they come up with, and those who start commercial businesses in new areas or in competition with the privitization companies. </p>
    <p><h6>Living in the Commons</h6>A sizable fraction spend their free time on activities with no clear goal. Their sense of security is very high. Food, shelter, medical care, transport, utilities, basics for clothing, furnishings, and household goods, communication and internet access - all of these things are free. The food even includes a modicum of the extras from Earth that have become part of standard shipments - coffee, cheese, preserved meats and seafood, sweets, sauces. They each get a new mobile computer every time the MA upgrades, for the purpose of doing MA work. They get annual care packages of favored clothing and personal items. They are set for life - that was the deal.</p>
    <p>Because the community remains small and close-knit, and is composed of very successful people specifically chosen for their stability, adaptability, and keen minds, the dichotomy of commercial and non-commercial approaches coexists without significant issues arising. A social order takes hold that is centered on the group of people with whom a colonist shares kitchen and bath. Most administration is done via these groups.</p>
    <h5>Residence Program Round 5</h5>
    <p>Once the lower tether of the Earth skyhook is in place, it is used to transport most of the round 5 astronauts to the Moon. </p>
