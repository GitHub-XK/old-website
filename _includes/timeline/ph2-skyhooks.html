  <p>With enough infrastructure now on the Moon that trip times are less important, the Pod Ships are switched over to 
  <ul>
   <li><h6>7500 ton Asteroid for the Anchor</h6> is brought into medium polar orbit, 5000 km above the surface. Surveys of Near Earth Asteroids will be much more complete by then, so it is reasonable to expect a carbonaceous asteroid that is suitable will have been found and collected. Its content of carbon and metal would be its most valuable contribution, as water is being mined from the lunar pole at less expense. But its hydrated minerals are still of value.</li>
   <li><h6>Gear Installed and Tested</h6> Zylon cables, construction equipment, solar panels and ion engines, and a nuclear-powered cable car are brought from Earth to the asteroid. Some small scale tests will already have been done in preparation. Now further testing and experimentation is done to ensure a robust design.</li>
   <li><h6>Tether Extended Downwards</h6> from the asteroid towards the surface. The first increment is only a few kilometers, then a hundred kilometers is added, than a thousand. The platform at the foot, the procedure by which the nuclear shuttle meets it and is grappled, oscillation control on the tether, the cable car, and cable car propulsion are all thoroughly tested at these scales and further refined.</li>
   <li><h6>Full Lower Tether</h6>The tether is extended in increments of 1000 km until it reaches an altitude of 20 km above the surface.</li>
   <li><h6>Cable Car Propulsion</h6>The first cable car is nuclear, but it may receive supplemental power beamed from the asteroid in order to increase its capacity. The best method for powering future cars may be beamed power, or nuclear might be the best solution.</li>
   <li><h6>Skyhook's Momentum Saves 4/5th of Delta V</h6> the nuclear shuttle will only need to use 1/5th of the delta V needed to reach and return from lunar orbit to reach the platform of the tether foot and return. It will need that same 1/5th of the normal delta V to go anywhere on the Moon by grappling the platform and hanging off it until it is over its destination, and to return to base the same way. </li>
   <li><h6>Upper Tether</h6> is extended upwards 9500 km, given a cable car designed to ferry ships from the anchor, and a platform at the tip. At the altitude of the tip, release of a vessel gives it enough speed to reach Earth. This construction proceeds much faster as the process is now understood.</li>
   <li><h6>Platform HiPEP Ion Engines</h6> The engines are moved from the asteroid to the tether tip where their force is most effective in maintaining the skyhook's orbit. Short-term, orbital perturbations are compensated for by moving cars that act as counterweights up or down the two tethers. In case of emergency, if somehow the orbital altitude of the structure has lowered and the foot is at risk of crashing into the ground and being dragged across it, a nuclear thermal rocket engine can fire at the tether tip to quickly raise orbit.</li>
   <li><h6>Conversion of the Asteroid to a Space Station</h6> Early steps in that direction are carried out during skyhook construction, replacing payloads of asteroid material with simple vessels and beams made of fused regolith.</li>
   <li><h6>5 km/s Delta V now saved between Moon and Earth</h6>The full skyhook saves about 2 km/s delta V to get something to the Moon from Earth, and 3 km/s to get something back.</li>
   <li><h6>Cheap Moon Fuel</h6>The mining of ice from the poles now is used to fuel the pod ship on the Earth/Moon run, and the nuclear shuttles, completely. Some water is shipped to the space station in LEO so it can be a fuel depot for other ships.</li>
  </ul>
<h5>Expansion of Crossroads Skyhook</h5>
<h5>Launch of the Asteroid Fetcher</h5>
  <h5>Sagan Skyhook and Telescope</h5>
<p>The asteroid retrieval ship remains connected to the anchor asteroid at first, then it is taken apart and upgraded. It gets bigger engines and larger solar panels, its asteroid bagging equipment is improved. While work on the skyhook proceeds, it is sent out again to get a larger asteroid of 25 kilotons.</p>
<p><b>Cargo runs between LEO and the polar skyhook now occur at every opportunity: every 2 weeks, 26 per year.</b></p>
