  <summary><h5><a href="machines2.html#TetherTransport">Gagarin Skyhook and Anchor Station</a></h5></summary>
  <p>This process is a repeat of building Crossroads, except much faster, and much bigger. At least, Gagarin is set up from the outset to grow into the future shipyard, full orbital colony, and manufacturing center it will later be. The superstructure delivered from the EESS is much larger, as is its wing of solar panels. The deployment of the cables, cars, and all its parts goes faster the second time around. The LNCs on the surface begin sending up full loads of regolith, rock, and water that add anchoring mass to the station, as soon as the lower tether is close to its full length.
  </p>
  <p>Because it is in an equatorial orbit, ships can launch from it or dock with it at any time of the month (Crossroads is only properly aligned for that twice a month). Another important new feature of Gagarin is that its upper tether extends to 17500 km above the lunar surface. At that altitude, the outward velocity imparted to a vessel hanging on to it is enough to fling it all the way to Venus, or Mars. All that has to be done is to detach from the cable at the right moment.</p>
  <h5>Expansion of Crossroads Skyhook</h5>
  <p>The solar array wing of Crossroads is greatly expanded, in preparation for beaming of power to Lalande Crater for upcoming construction. The Station is upgraded and expanded to accommodate a crew of 50 who stay for terms of 1 to 5 years. It gets a centrifuge so that they can do so without risk to their health.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Some materials sent up from the surface now are actual structures fabricated at the colony. Their materials are fairly crude, but they are sturdy because weight doesn't really matter - making the anchor heavy is part of the goal. Thus they are strong enough to do their jobs. Pressure vessels, tanks, and trusses are sent up and added to the stations.</li>
      <li>The tethers of Gagarin are upgraded throughout this period to handle ever greater loads. By the end of it both tethers can handle up to a kiloton of material at a time.</li>
      <li>Both skyhooks spend more time ferrying LNCs around the Moon, as there are now many missions to different spots on its surface. Several deposits of pure metal have been found in the central peaks of craters - remains of the meteors that impacted there, ones that came in slowly enough, at the right angle, to not have vaporized completely. Those deposits are being mined, both for the metal, and for accompanying carbon minerals. Also there are lots of exploration missions with science objectives, to lava tubes, volcanic regions, the south pole, and the far side, where a radio telescope is being set up.</li>

  <summary><h5>Lunar Fleet Expansion</h5></summary>
  <p>The Pod ship and LNC fleet is expanded to support construction of Gagarin and Sagan skyhooks, and greatly increased sortie missions. Four Pod Ships ply the route to the Moon, 2 meeting Crossroads and 2 going to the equator to build Gagarin, and then Sagan. These two then do Gagarin's transport runs. They are larger - they can break Earth orbit carrying 250 tons. The LNC fleet increases to six. Four LNCs support Inukshuk, including sortie missions to other parts of the Moon and delivering fuel to the LNCs working on what will be Gagarin Skyhook. Those two LNCs are larger, capable of flying 60 ton payloads to the foot of Gagarin once it is commissioned. </p>
  <p>A new class of ship is also created - Hopper ships. These ships transfer cargo between skyhooks, avoiding the inefficiency of sending something down a tether to a LNC, which than takes it to the destination tether, whose climber takes it up to that station. Hoppers instead climb a little up the upper tether of their skyhook and let go, so that at the top of the arc of their orbit, they can do the plane change that puts them on course to rendezvous with the anchor station of the destination skyhook, or a waystation platform part way along the upper tether. They use ordinary hydrolox engines, like the Pod ships, and can transfer up to 5 tons this way. They aren't capable of landing on the Moon's surface. </p>
  <p>The Fetch ship also make their debut in the Lunar Fleet, but they deserve their own section</p>

  <summary><h5>Day of the Asteroid Fetchers</h5></summary>
    <p>The hunt for near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is on, using the 3 fetcher spacecraft maintained at the ready, berthed at waystations on Gagarin's upper tether. They are sent along the upper tethers and released at the altitude and moment that puts them on the best available trajectory to whatever opportune NEA is detected. The speed and trajectory imparted on release leave these craft with more fuel available for pushing the asteroid into a trajectory back to lunar orbit. They have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket">VASMIR engines</a> powered by solar panels and fueled by hydrogen. Their fuel tanks are filled just before launch from larger cryogenic tanks set up at the waystations. These storage tanks are well-sheltered from solar heat by cones of specialized multi-layer insulation and have their own cryogenic chilling mechanisms to reduce losses due to boil-off.</p>
    <p>The craft use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKli3zIDFoM">SHEPHERD</a> approach of <a href="http://www.digitalspace.com/papers/SHEPHERD/Jenniskens-Damer-et-al-SHEPHERDspace20140024.pdf">enveloping the NEA</a>. In this method, a giant open bag is positioned around the asteroid and then its end is drawn closed. The bag is filled with xenon gas which is then circulated with fans. The turbulence this produces slowly stops the asteroid's spin and tumble. In this way, the many asteroids that are very fragile don't disintegrate. They are returned in their original state, allowing us to study their structure. The bags on these Fetchers can surround an object up to 10 m across. If the trajectory and speed of the NEA is fortuitous, the Fetchers can return an asteroid of up to 3 kilotons.</p>
    <p>Gagarin's tip platform is equipped with telescopes specialized to search for just such targets, which are largely unknown objects detected only when they are very close. Two such telescopes slung under the platform, on bases that isolate them from its motions, scan the sky constantly for tiny, dim NEAs. They identify targets automatically, compute their parameters, and send in the information to the anchor station. By the time a human is alerted, the station's computers have plotted a rendezvous trajectory and possibly even a fetch ship is being prepped. It is possible with such tiny objects that the window of opportunity is soon and brief. Even with the optimized telescopes, a good target might become visible only hours before its closest approach - especially the dark ones full of valuable carbon. The crew only has to approve the launch, and a fetcher will take off by itself and do the rest.</p>
    <p>Once caught and marshalled, the asteroid is put on a course for Sagan Skyhook. Done with that trip, the Hoppers help them back to Gagarin, and they take up their station again. Once we get the hang of this, the fetchers are upgraded for even bigger catches.</p>

  <summary><h5>Sagan Skyhook and Telescope</h5></summary>
  <p>The third skyhook is not for shipping things to space. Its main purpose is research. It has two major research projects. First, when the fetch ships come in with a bagged asteroid, they gently pull in to the anchor station, which has specialized berths for just this situation. Hoppers may render assistance if the fetcher is getting low on fuel. Here, the asteroid can be studied over time in detail without other station operations getting in the way, as they likely would on the busy stations at Crossroads and Gagarin. Sagan has space for all three fetch ships, and more space so the asteroids can be unbagged and nudged into a berth of their own. </p>
  <p> This easy-going situation for collected asteroids won't last, though. Once an asteroid has been thoroughly studied, unless it is very special indeed, it gets mined. What doesn't go down the tether is sent by the Hoppers to Gagarin for the shipyard and factories. Eventually, when Gagarin is more mature, it will make more sense to ship asteroids directly to Gagarin. Then Sagan's asteroid docks will be converted for other research purposes best done on an isolated, specialized station.</p>
  <p>Sagan also has a giant telescope fitted on its tip platform that would make the James Webb blush. It is carefully isolated from motions transmitted up the tether and very well shielded from heat and electromagnetic noise. The tether allows it to be easily serviced and upgraded over time, and also allows it to be huge and heavy while remaining agile.</p>
  <p> Incidentally, Sagan is also around so that LNCs hitching a ride can get to any given spot on the Moon once a week, instead of once every two weeks. Its foot platform can grapple and hold hitchhiking LNCs, but cargo doesn't go up its tether, only down. So its climber car is stripped down as it needs much less power. It can lower 40 tons but can lift only 1 ton, which it does on solar power and energy stored from the descent in batteries. No power is beamed along the tether, its maintenance carts get around on power from their own solar panels, and work at a leisurely pace.

<summary><h5>Expansion of the EESS</h5></summary>
<p>A second, larger spinning section is added to the EESS, this time made mostly of lunar materials, including some structural elements. It looks sort of like a spinning top. Engineering of equipment for the Moon is now done mostly on the EESS, in a ring section open to vacuum extending from the first torus, spinning at lunar gravity levels, parts of it carpeted with a layer of genuine lunar regolith to imitate the Moon's surface. The Hexagon is extended to have several levels. Modules within it develop microgravity and vacuum manufacturing.</p>
