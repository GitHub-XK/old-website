    <h2>Transport cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Asteroid for Equatorial skyhook arrives in orbit</h5>
    <p>
    This is going to be the real transport hub for the Moon, together with Cernan's Promise and later Lalande City. It develops into a colony in its own right. It is another carbonaceous asteroid, this time massing 25 metric kilotons. It is placed in a circular orbit 5000 km above the surface, so that it has the same orbital period as Sagan Skyhook and they will never be at risk of collision.
    </p>
    <p>
    Upper and lower tethers just like the ones on Sagan are built outwards from the asteroid. These will be reinforced to take bigger payloads over time, and to run multiple payload cars up and down.
    </p>
    <h5>Reusable Rockets</h5>
    <p>The launch rates needed to accomplish the missions after Residence Program Round 2 require one of two things: much higher public enthusiasm for space, or much cheaper launch costs. Rocket stages that are used many times with modest refurbishment in between can reduce launch costs to a fraction of current costs. Roughly, a reusable first stage like SpaceX currently targets, that can be reliably and cheaply reused 20 times, might drop costs to half what they are now. A reusable second stage with the same properties, and mass production rates giving economies of scale, might halve that again.</p>
    <p>There has been enough success to date to clearly indicate someone is going to manage this, be it SpaceX, or Blue Origin, or one of the more established rocket companies. It might take longer than hoped, but it is going to happen.</p>
    <p>The launches needed for Resident Program Rounds 1 and 2 can be done at the best prices currently charged. Plans would not proceed unless Inukshuk Base was producing enough water to provide for all the residents and the needs of the base, and to fuel the shuttle and the pod ship. Thus the tonnage of supplies that would have to be delivered would be manageable. A healthy margin on those astronauts can be had in this architecture, to recoup the costs up to this point. It is important not to proceed unless the robots have preformed up to spec, but once they do, costs are well controlled.</p>
    <p>Rounds 3 and 4 would not yield much margin unless launch costs do drop a lot, or other revenue streams are sufficient. That is the time that depends most on public enthusiasm either justifying the cost or creating the revenue to support it (through broadcasting and such). </p>

    <h2>Colony Dev. cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Expansion of Inukshuk colony</h5>
    <p>
    The First Hab crew and the astronauts of the RP build more infrastructure at Inukshuk. More robotic equipment arrives from Earth to assist, including better 3d printers, reactors for chemical processing, and more advanced robots and rovers. They work through the following list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>Expand ice mining</h6>, separating out a greater range of ice chemicals,  setting up operations in several locations, and raising yield dramatically.</li>
      <li><h6>Quartz production</h6>Develop a good industrial process to produce fused quartz glass, and glass fibers suitable for use as reinforcement in a fused regolith matrix. Once developed, the machinery to do it is built on Earth and shipped up.</li>
      <li><h6>Expand the greenhouses</h6> with the goal of producing most of the residents' food on-site. Improve the range and yield of edible plants grown. Begin raising edible insects as a source of quality protein and fat. Once achieved, about three quarters of calories come from local food, but key things still come from Earth. Oils, grains, and legumes are sent because local production is insufficient, and portions of customary foods are sent because people really miss them - coffee, chocolate, cheese, cured meats, nuts, and some fresh meats and perishables on each run.</li>
      <li><h6>Expand the TESS</h6>The solar thermal plant's capacity is increased to serve all local power needs and provide a source of molten regolith for reactors and construction. A good fraction of this structure is built on-site.</li>
      <li><h6>Build a radio telescope</h6> in a small crater - a fixed one in which the whole crater is simply lined with a mirror, and shaded from Earth to block its radio noise.</li>
      <li><h6>Send the heavy equipment to Lalande</h6>Once the above infrastructure is done, and all the heavy work is done on local buildings, it goes and builds Cernan's Promise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Socio-Economic Dev. cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Ordinary Life on the Moon</h5>
    <p>The 200 residents from RP round 1 work alongside the 50 First Hab crew to achieve the listed goals. English is the working language. The First Hab crew are the senior staff, and lead RP crews on the various projects. Work largely continues to be done remotely from within the habs at interface stations. </p>
    <p>Each married couple has a small apartment. Kitchens, bathrooms, showers, clothes washers, and everything else that involves plumbing, waste processing, or food is in centralized facilities shared by everyone. The second hab is known as Long Hab, thanks to its long narrow shape. It has a common exercise area, multi-use gathering area, and workshop for the use of residents on their own time. The greenhouses are also set up partially as relaxation and exercise areas. </p>
    <h5>Health Program Developed</h5>
    <p>The First Hab crew stayed healthy before this by an intensive exercise program modeled on that developed for the ISS, but with time better approaches are found.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>Manual centrifuge</h6> this looks sort of like a wide bicycle wheel on its side whose axle is connected to a platform where people spin the wheel using pure muscle power. It takes a while to get going but can then be maintained fairly easily at an RPM that imitates 1 gravity of force for the people on the rim of the wheel. People spend at least an hour on the wheel at a time, at least several times a week, so their circulatory system can redistribute fluids and to relieve other subtle issues with long term low gravity living. Exercise needs to be done while under the full gravity. The exercise of pushing the wheel is also beneficial. Motors are also added so there is no need to push, but usually they aren't used. </li>
      <li><h6>Swimming pool</h6> The water gotten from the ice mining makes this rather easy to do. At first it is a couple of shallow swimming lanes, then a deep end is added, then a diving tank, and the whole thing is made deeper to take full advantage of the kind of swimming lunar gravity makes possible. The benefit of swimming in low gravity is that the water has the same inertia as it has on Earth, so the force needed to push it aside is almost the same. Swimming is the same kind of workout on the Moon as it is here. </li>
      <li><h6>Lunar parkour</h6> The kind of constant downward pull we feel on Earth can be acquired briefly on the Moon by jumping over a high enough distance, or climbing upwards fast enough. Instead of stairs, tubes are used to move between floors, where you grab the sides and haul yourself up. With practise, residents learn to do this so fast it is a sort of vertical running. People often jump between floors as well. It becomes a passtime to find new and exciting ways to move around the habs by bouncing off walls, swinging from things, and jumping great distances. </li>
      <li><h6>Lunar gym</h6> In order to get the same kind of acceleration-oriented exercise, the gym area is the full height of Long Hab, and its floor is so heavily padded that even if someone jumps from the very top if it, they will land unharmed. The foam used is stiff enough that in the low gravity it can be walked over fairly normally, but yeilds sufficiently to absorb the energy of a jump from a great height. The padded walls are covered with small ledges and recesses for hand and foot holds, there are a bunch of ropes and nets hanging from ceiling to floor. The residents quickly start inventing vertically oriented sports and games. </li>
    </ul>
