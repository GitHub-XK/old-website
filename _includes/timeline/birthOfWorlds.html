      <summary><h2>The Birth of Worlds</h2></summary>
      <p>As this timeline closes, the slope of the curve is only getting steeper. With skyhooks tossing great ships back and forth and robots swarming outwards, bent on building vast and magical things all across the solar system, humanity's sense of identity has not simply been shifted. It's been challenged.
      </p>
      <p>To appreciate the nature of Moonwards, one must understand that all these things will come to pass before the turn of the century. The details will be different, but the scope will be just like this. It is likely that the 50 year timeline shown here is about the time we have before this is the solar system we live in. Once we pass certain thresholds, the scale of our undertakings will explode in size so dramatically, it falls to us now to carefully contemplate what it really means to be human. That task must be well underway, and a consensus gelling, before we hold the power in our hands that this future will bestow upon us.
      </p>
      <p>The technical skills this timeline assumes we acquire are a reasonable guess, if anything on the conservative side. The question is what we will do with those skills. So let us consider exactly how vast this future is, in this vision where our focus is on growth of this kind. At the opening of this phase, new worlds are being born across the solar system.
      </p>
      <p>The Moon has everything it needs to become home to millions of people. A number of critical things must be imported, but the Moon easily has the cash for that. Besides, it's largely the Moon that is building the infrastructure to get those imports in bulk, and that benefits everyone, in ways we won't even see until we have such infrastructure. The Skyhook Interplanetary Transport Hubs are an extraordinary achievement, the Autobahn system of space.
      </p>
      <p>It gets water and ammonia from Callisto; water, graphite, and a mix of salts from Ceres; nitrogen and methane from Titan; carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon from Venus and Mars. Supplementing the rare metals that come from asteroid mining near the Moon are metal shipments from Mercury and Psyche. A few important chemicals still come from Earth - boron, iodine, fluorine. That's everything it must have in great quantity to build a civilization. It takes a lot of ships to bring in the amounts needed for the rapid development of new surface cities, cylinder colonies, and all its manufacturing. Like a highway system, it is only with a high level of traffic that the skyhooks shine as a cheap and versatile means of transport. Hundreds of Toss ships are plying those routes by the end of Phase 4. In a few years, there are thousands, and they have gotten even larger. All of these materials and more are being traded across the solar system, enabling every world in the SITH to also be home to millions.
      </p>
      <p>The Moonwards logo, of cities sparkling at night across the face of the Moon, is a real thing in only a few more decades in this reality, with its focus on such growth. Giant bubble cities of a million people float in the skies of Venus. With the question of ensuring a habitat for native life resolved, cities start to sprout across Mars, starting from the vast caldera of Arsia Mons. Vast ice castles are built on Ceres and Callisto. A city grows in Tolkien Crater at Mercury's north pole. All the surface skyhooks sprout cylinder colonies, several of those grow quickly.
      </p>
      <p>On Earth, power now mostly comes from space. Electrical power... and power in general. The backbone of this world's communications, data services, and electrical systems reside in space. Key manufacturing industries are mostly in space too. Microchips, CNT cable and graphene are plausible cases of this, there will surely be others we can't anticipate. A place that controls all of these things has tremendous economic and political power.
      </p>
      <p>It also has unassailable military power, so much so, that in order to realize this future, it is imperative that Earth unify sufficiently that war between nations is no longer imaginable. Only a century ago, Europe rushed blindly into the greatest war humanity had ever known (at the time). Today war between Europe's great powers is unimaginable. This is a great achievement. All we need to do is repeat it, in the next thirty years. Preferably, without learning how by enduring the suffering of another world war.
      </p>
      <p>We must also maintain good bonds with all our lunar colonies. A Moon with an actual city on it like Lalande and skyhooks like Gagarin and Magnificent Desolation would be a formidable enemy. The Moon's capacity to launch missiles is vastly superior because of its low gravity and lack of an atmosphere. The radiation shielding around every inhabited space is also impact shielding - heavy fortification comes included in the package. The Moon need not fear radiation from nuclear weapons, it's already built to block high radiation and it has no water or air that radioactive particles can spread through.
      </p>
      <p>For the perfect super-villain storyline, a war-like lunar culture could choose not to target Earth directly. Instead, it could go after its sunlight. With its capacity to launch in bulk, it could send enough simple solar sails to the Earth Sun L1 point to block out some 5% or so of Earth's sunlight, sending the planet into permanent winter. The deliciously evil thing about this is that it would be like having a dimmer switch on planet Earth. The orbits of the sails could be dilated or constricted in a few days to let all the sun in, or adjust how much is being blocked.
      </p>
      <p>That dark future could be executed by other planets as well. It's best just to avoid the whole idea by ensuring we don't fall to such demented depths. We probably would never do such a thing to each other anyhow. We aren't so bad. We're just immature.</p>
      <p>The point here really is that this is how much power is coming our way. That same plan when applied to Venus isn't evil at all, it's a great first step to making the surface accessible, and creating a better environment for the floating cities. A plan to block a large fraction of the sunlight from reaching Venus would allow it to slowly cool. The scale of such a project would take a few decades to complete, and then the results would not be very noticeable for a few decades more. But it would be an actual initial step towards an era of terraforming, one we would be completely capable of.
      </p>
      <p>We are going to have the power to change the face of planets, and we will. It is foolish to turn away from that as though we can make it not happen by forbidding it. It's even more foolish, and rather sad, to think we shouldn't. Yes, we will very probably make mistakes that do a lot of damage, but we'll learn from that and do better. Only if we exercise the power we have will we grow, only by owning up to our true natures will we learn to repair the damage we've done to our own planet in our innocent youth.
      </p>
      <p>Our sense of identity is about to be challenged, and we will respond by reorganizing ourselves around a new central project. That is what humanity has always done in the past at such moments. That central project will allow us to define ourselves in a way that gives us a sense of purpose, one so clear and strong we can all unify around it and set aside all differences of real consequence. Upon contemplating our past, and our present, and our dreams, and the powers we are pursuing, what that central project is seems clear.
