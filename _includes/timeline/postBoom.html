    <h2>Transport cont'd - and More</h2>
    <h5>Lots and lots of ships and launchers</h5>
    <p>Lalande factories now make all the components for complete ships which are assembled at the  Gagarin Shipyard. There are many kinds, which may be for passengers or automated, specialized for a variety of environments such as Jupiter's radiation or Mercury's intense sun, and a wide variety of tasks, on a wide range of scales:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-thrust ships
        <ul>
          <li>Solar sail and light sail</li>
          <li>Nuclear electric powered</li>
          <li>Solar electric powered</li>
          <li>Using ion drives</li>
          <li>Or coil guns</li>
          <li>Or experimental drives that show promise: Neumann drives, Em drives, or Mach drives</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>High-thrust ships
        <ul>
          <li>Nuclear thermal</li>
          <li>Liquid chemical rockets</li>
          <li>Solid chemical rockets</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Launching machines
          <ul>
            <li>Skyhooks</li>
            <li>Sling launchers</li>
            <li>Coil Guns</li>
            <li>Lasers for light sails</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>And Lots of Other Big Fancy Machines</h5>
    <p>Very large space solar power installations can now compete with power generation on Earth, or power things in space. A laser for propelling a small vessel to a neighbouring star is built. A few telescopes of truly mind-bending power are built. </p>

    <h2>Colony Dev cont'd</h2>
    <h5>Lalande City Fills Up</h5>
    <p> The city is opened for habitation just before the Residence Program is over. When people start to move in, there are some ground rules.</p>
    <p><h6>The Great Outdoors of Lalande</h6>The floor of the crater is for orchards and parkland exclusively, except for a few large structures for gatherings - one giant stadium, several smaller arenas, several open-air theaters also usable as forums, and a smattering of plazas. It takes a few years before all that area is planted, but nobody is permitted to build there. Camping is permitted. </p>
    <p><h6>And the Great Indoors</h6>The towers, the rim structures, and all the large voids created by mining are used for living, leisure, and work space. The largest beams between towers also have multi-level bridges hanging under them wide enough that they are lined with buildings. People also work in the factories (not as laborers, but as engineers, technicians and administrators) and research facilities surrounding the crater. The tallest towers are 5 km high and house 40,000 people each once fully developed. It takes about 20 years for the city to fill up with people, and when the population reaches its designated limit, the city is home to 1.5 million people. After that property may change hands but no new homes are allowed. Population growth is directed to newer cities.</p>
    <p> <h6>Local Bounty</h6>The orchards and other crops provide about 90% of the citizens' food. (They could provide all of it. The only reason they don't is because people still want a few choice things that can only come from Earth.) In the ideal, pest-free growing environment, trees bear fruit three times a year. Thanks to breeding and genetic manipulation, the trees grow to gigantic heights. Each harvest is a tremendous amount of food. Only trees, bushes, and vines that produce food crops are grown on the ground (and assorted light undergrowth). Slowly rotating hanging gardens far above produce vegetables, herbs, and medicinals. As the sun during the day is so strong, these gardens are necessary to weaken the light hitting the ground by creating a partly cloudy feeling, while making best use of that energy to produce food. At night the hanging gardens are kept healthy with artificial light. The woody plants on the ground also receive a bit of supplemental light, but they have been bred to handle the long nights. They go into hibernation at these times and are not affected much. Specialized greenhouses near the crater produce grains and legumes at high density using mechanized rotating trays and light distributed through fiberoptic cables. Carbon dioxide levels are maintained at about 2000 parts per million in the city, 5 times current levels on Earth, to aid plant growth. </p>
    <p>Animal husbandry is also practised. Bees produce honey, chickens produce eggs (and chicken meat), a number of edible insects and larvae are farmed, as are a few kinds of fish. Farming of iguanas has worked out well. The chickens wander free in the orchards, and have tiny trackers that make locating their nests quite easy. A number of insects have been introduced as pollinators, and also some hummingbirds and bats. There are a variety of reptiles and birds. There were some problems with population explosions, and so cats are introduced. Dogs, however, have no role in the ecosystem. Some are brought as pets but they are not permitted to reproduce. Other animals that have been sterilized are permitted for study or as pets. New species are only introduced after much study. The addition of many things, such as small fast-breeding mammals or very large animals, is considered unwise. Goats and sheep are added in small numbers. Extensive tracking is done on animal populations and anything large and long-lived enough to have a pinhead-sized tracker, has one. </p>
    <p><h6>Environmental Control</h6>The crater has several tiny lakes, a few artificial creeks, and a complex system of aquariums for aquaculture. There is a sort of suspended sprinkler system that is a bit like rain that falls in small patches. Very large lightweight reflectors are used to increase sunlight levels near dawn and dusk, and reduce them at noon. Temperature regulation is done mostly by pumping heat into the ground and some use of radiators. Power continues to be mostly TESS plants, with some nuclear generators mixed in, and perhaps some solar power beamed from the skyhooks.</p>

    <h2>Socio-Economic Dev cont'd</h2>
    <h5>A Truly Unique Society</h5>
    <p>When residence is opened to any applicant, there is a flood of interest. The MA, and the Moon's general population, are leery of how this will affect their cozy, cerebral society. The MA decides to continue to impose some conditions on who qualifies, and creates an application structure that inherently favors certain qualities. Principally, they make it so long and involved that it requires considerable patience, concentration, and persistence to complete it. The MA also decides to accept only 15,000 applicants a year for the first 5 years, and then raise the number to 50,000 for 5 years, and then to 100,000 or 10% of the Moon's total population, whichever is more. There continue to be many more applicants than spaces for decades. Some applicants pay the fee by making agreements to do work for some entity when they arrive. </p>
    <p>A few spots are handed out by lottery, after which a winner need only comply with the basic qualifications of a clean criminal record and good physical health. They must also pay the fee.</p>
    <h5>Children on the Moon</h5>
    <p>It starts being possible to raise children in Lalande City from a younger and younger age, if a program of exercise is followed and some highly targeted hormonal drugs are used at certain ages. Once a child is able to be physically active in an independent way, they can live on the Moon - usually starting around age 3. Then they are able to do the important exercises needed to maintain health. Exercise programs are designed for children that are more enjoyable for them and tailored to their needs, and there are many places in the colony where they can do them together, in classes with teachers. They need more time in higher simulated gravity, and very spacious centrifuges are created for them. It isn't easy or pleasant to move around a lot in these centrifuges. You can stand and move around, helped by the slanted floors and plenty of railings, but you are always being pulled in two directions - 1 g outwards and 1/6th g downwards. Children are given quiet things to do when they are there, or nap, or sometimes sleep overnight there.</p>
    <p><h6>Prioritizing Children</h6>For a long time children continue to be uncommon enough that they are really very pampered and are cared for in a highly communal way. When couples return to their lunar homes with their toddlers, their cliques become an enthusiastic band of uncles, aunts, and grandparents. The average age on the Moon at the end of the RP is mid-50s. The dearth of children is widely seen by colonists as the city's greatest flaw. Even a decade after settlement is opened up, many bands don't even have one child in their midst. Children can wander around freely because everyone looks out for them. The MA begins favoring settlers with plans to have children.</p>
    <p><h6>Gagarin's Family Hub</h6>The lunar population would like families to be able to stay, through pregnancy and their children's infancy, without the huge interruption to community life caused by leaving for Earth until their child is 3. They would like more children around, and want to make that as easy as possible for people. So an installation is created on Gagarin Station for couples who are pregnant or have infants. Gagarin already has hotels and installations on spinning levels that simulate Earth gravity, but a new one is made that caters purely to these families and is specialized for their needs. It is large enough to accomodate hundreds of young families, and is designed to be extended in phases to handle tens of thousands. It is basically an O'Niell cylinder built onto the top of Gagarin (in two balanced halves so it doesn't create torque on the station). </p>
    <p> By combining staying on this station with use of the centrifuges when they visit Lalande, couple are able to maintain ties and continue working with much less interruption. Many couples adopt this approach, some couples prefer to go to Earth through this period.  </p>
    <p><h6>Utopia Under Glass?</h6>Because the populations remains highly selected for qualities valued by the astronauts of the RP, its strong inclination towards a communal approach to life becomes ever more ingrained. The environment is almost completely controlled, there has always been plenty of money flowing to keep the vested interests back on Earth happy, the population very heavily favors pursuit of knowledge over wealth, and there are absolutely no economic pressures on anyone - their needs are all looked after.</p>
    <p>All this, and the approach to currency, contracts, and disputes, and the cellular structure of the society, has prevented authority from becoming concentrated. People identify very strongly with their cliques, and the cliques protect their members energetically, so there never appears any unprotected underclass, or any privileged overclass. The population doesn't think much about self-determination, because there is no conflict with Earth. Earth governments are fine with them administering their own affairs, as there is plenty of room for companies to spring up and grow, most research and technical innovation is shared thanks to long-standing open-source policies, and the MA has done a good job making sure all business operations have access to the power, telecoms, transport, and other infrastructure they need. </p>
    <p>Of course, something has to disturb this Shangri-La. Perhaps it should be the creation of another city, built by a private real-estate enterprise. The MA has been allowed to control Lalande City, Inukshuk, and the space stations because they are part of the original international deal that got the Moon settled. But now nations and groups want to strike out on their own and create something different. One of the first such enterprises builds a Las Vegas in space that violates most of Lalande City's ideals. </p>
