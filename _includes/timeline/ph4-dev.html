      <summary><h5>End-to-End Robots</h5></summary>
        <p>Robots move from being able to execute a step-by-step plan, to being able to make a plan that will satisfy a set of objectives they have been tasked with fulfilling. The first mega-project they are then tasked with is the construction of Lalande City. The robot team that does it is presented with detailed engineering plans for the city and some parameters for the resources they may use, and told 'go'.
        </p>
        <p>They start by building the new factories for the various materials the city requires. They prototype the robots needed for all the different construction tasks, test them, improve them, and prototype again until they are satisfied they meet suitable standards. Then they build the factories for those robots, and the power plants needed to run them. The first robots stabilize and seal the interior of the crater, prepare the rim with the foundation for the dome that will cover it, and the foundations of all the towers dotted throughout it. The next wave starts building the central towers, and uses them to support the frames of the dome sections. The dome frames and the towers both are slowly expanded, upwards and outwards, until all the towers are their full height and the full armature of the dome is sitting atop them, and the rim structure ringing in the crater. A temporary membrane is used to seal the dome and a thin atmosphere is pumped into the crater, so that the millions of glass sections for the dome can be laid in their frames and built up layer by layer. More power plants are built, and all the infrastructure to supply the city - air, water, thermal control, waste recycling, supplementary greenhouses, telecoms, computation, transit systems, centrifuges, airlocks, lighting, monitoring, emergency services... The city is pressurized up to a full atmosphere and all systems tested.
        </p>
        <p> They lay down topsoil over the crater's interior, setting up terraces and mesh to retain soil on slopes. They plant initial cover crops and test the artificial waterways, the intricate web of irrigation and drainage pipes, and the artificial rain system. Once satisfied, they plant all the trees, bushes, vines, and cacti - anything that lives for years. They build the roads and paths all through the gardens. Humans help a bit during this part, where they want to put in a few personal touches or enjoy the gardening.
        </p>
        <p>At the end of this phase, 15 years after the project started, the city is ready for habitation and rated for a population of a million people. As the robots finish each phase of construction, the ones specializing in that phase are reassigned to the other mega-projects being undertaken elsewhere - the build Anshar Station, and then Hepit Foot Station, then the cylinder colonies of Magnificent Desolation. The factories that built those robots first refit or replace the robots working in the factories of Cernan's Promise, and expand those factories to help supply the mega-projects. Then they build new robot crews so they can build the cylinders for all the other skyhooks.
        </p>
        <p>Once all these robots finish, shortly into the next phase, they need to be assigned to something else. Some are instructed to keep building more cities on the Moon. Those next cities start without an initial colony nearby to support the initial phases of the project, or even detailed plans. But that's okay. They figure out how to build that initial base for operations, and how to adapt the previous plans to the new craters. They start turning out a new city every decade, rated for populations of one to two million. The implications of all this are discussed in Birth of Worlds</p>
        <p>Robots become sort of invisible hands that look after all the details, leaving humans free for creative, intellectual, and spiritual pursuits. They do not develop wills of their own.</p>

      <summary><h5>Lalande City</h5></summary>
        <p>The dome over Lalande Crater is 23 km across on average. The rim ring is 250 m wide, rises 400 m above the rim, and extends 300 m below it. It is heavily reinforced with thick cables that connect to the cables of the dome, and anchor them to the bedrock through shafts at hundreds of points. There are over 80 towers spread throughout the crater that anchor the dome at those points, containing the outward strain of the atmosphere pushing against it. Though the total thickness of the laminated glass of the dome is 3 m, it is still only a fraction of what it would take to counterbalance the pressure of the city's atmosphere. The towers are built around central cores of CNT cable. They are very solid structures of metal, glass, basalt, and composites capable of supporting the dome even if the city loses 95% of its atmosphere. In the center of Lalande they are 5 km tall, near the rim they are 1 km tall. The dome has been built around Cernan's Promise, now it is entirely indoors. It's buildings are preserved for history. </p>
        <p>The towers and rim are where people live in Lalande. The ground is set aside for 'nature'. It has a few facilities for physical activity or public gatherings, but 95% is vegetation or water bodies. Institutional buildings and hospitals are dotted around the crater floor, but they are subterranean, built inside artificial hillocks, hobbit style. Maintenance facilities are all truly subterranean, and inhabited solely by robots. Factories and research facilities are all outside the rim, as are power plants and supplementary greenhouses. Factories are also clustered along the tunnel to the space port 35 km northeast of the city.
        </p>
        <p>Very little of the vegetation is ornamental. It all produces something of value. Trees bear fruit and nuts, bushes are herbals or yield berries, vines have edible roots or fruit, whatever doesn't has medicinal bark, roots, or leaves, or perhaps is a host to a highly valued fungus or edible insect. The ecosystem requires constant adjustment, but only in ways subtle enough that to the untrained eye it is self-sustaining. Small vegetable gardens are scattered all over. Flower plots are set beside path intersections, benches, fountains, and plazas. Small animals and insects live in this groomed wilderness. Some are for food, some are pollinators, some balance the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p> For the most part, it isn't identifiable as farmland, though it all is. The robots don't plant single crops in neat rows, they mix everything together in careful ratios according to what is the best fit for the local soil and terrain, guided by the ecosystem engineers that oversee them. Lush natural ecosystems are imitated as closely as possible. They are able to monitor the environment so carefully that all animals roam free and live pretty natural lives - until it's time to roast them for dinner. In that case, the needed number are promptly captured and cleanly killed. Farming robots work so intimately with the ecosystem they almost seem like part of it. The colonists thus don't refer to it as the gardens or the farms, they call it the countryside.
        </p>
        <p> Once the countryside matures it is able to supply most of the population's food. The air has 2000 ppm carbon dioxide. The rains and irrigation are meted out for best growth. Strings of tiny lights woven into vast nets are carefully spread over everything during the lunar night to provide enough light energy to sustain all the plants. Each patch of these light-blankets provides light for stretches of 8 hours, and then switches off for 16, all through the night. There are no pests, no infections, no droughts, no frost, no storms, and no winter. Most woody plants and vines provide a harvest three times a year. Those harvests are staggered by design so that the supply of fresh produce is almost constant.
        </p>
        <p> A few key crops are grown in the supplemental greenhouses, mostly grains and legumes. Those greenhouses are completely optimized for maximum yield of whatever crop is in them. They have little free space and feel like factories. For maximum crop density, they are grown in trays that are supplied with sun by fiberoptic cables during the day, and by LEDs at night.
        </p>
        <p>In a similar fashion there are water and air treatment plants that use bacteria and algae to filter out toxins and disease agents. The algae tanks have light piped to them, the bacterial sludge is kept warm with waste heat.</p>
        <p>Broad suspension bridges link the towers, wide enough to be landscaped with gardens of their own and have kiosks and cafes dotted along them. They are spaced every kilometer up the towers. The arches between towers that support the dome also have several levels of walkways hanging beneath them. </p>
        <p>It takes a decade for the population of the city to fill out. While it does, the countryside fills out with it, the trees rising and thickening into forests, moss covering rocks, vines climbing the towers.</p>

      <summary><h5>Power Supply</h5></summary>
        <p>A mix of power sources is developed for the Moon. Nuclear reactors run on thorium and uranium, solar thermal plants produce power while melting regolith to extract volatiles and produce molten feedstock for production of glasses, ceramics, and metals, microwave rectenna grids receive power from orbital solar wings. Flywheels are used to smooth out the matching of supply and demand.</p>

      <summary><h5>Anshar Station</h5></summary>
        <p>As mentioned in the Anshar Skyhook section, mass is added to the anchor of Anshar as quickly as possible. Much of it arrives as rubble - fragile rubble pile asteroids are intentionally allowed to disintegrate during transport so they are easily mined to extract their carbon and water. The metal asteroid that arrived first and formed the initial anchor during skyhook construction is slowly processed to recover the metals dissolved in the iron that forms 92% of its mass. All of that metal is in high demand, but there is so much iron, and so many of its traditional uses have been taken over by other substances, it has little value. While it is still molten, at the end of the refining process, it is drawn into rods of between 10 and 100 m in length, whose ends are fused together into a gigantic latticework of tetrahedra. This latticework extends outward from a section three-quarters of the way up the enormous stone shaft bridging the center of gravity of the skyhook, where the upper and lower tethers are joined together. It is employed as bulk shelving and support frames for processing and fabrication units that operate within the lattice.
        </p>
        <p>As asteroid material is refined into carbon, water, pure metals, and metal oxides, these products are warehoused in the lattice. Slag, tailings, unused waste rock, and unused particles from gravel to dust, are carefully organized and stored in the lattice too, in case they prove useful later. They are archived according to composition, particle size, and origin. This forms the bulk of the mass of the anchor. A significant fraction of the mass is bags of compacted dust from Phobos.</p>
        <p>The stone shaft is a tube formed of a matrix of slag with fibers of high-strength glass and CNT mixed into it. Cables of CNT also run through it from end to end, and the tethers are fixed to the points where these cables protrude from the ends of the shaft. It is 100 km long and 50 m in diameter, with a hollow core 30 m wide. The climber cars travel through that hollow core on their way to the transfer hubs along it - Anshar Station, the industrial and shipping docks on top of the lattice, and the passenger spaceport just above those. The section where the iron lattice attaches to it is 5 km long.
        </p>
        <p>The center of gravity of the skyhook always stays within this length. It is designed to support any kind of forces either tether could ever be subjected to, and provide rigid support to all the structures built around it. Anshar Station is tucked under the lattice. The bulk in the lattice shields the station from radiation and impacts. It turns and extends downwards outside the station to protect its sides as well as its top. Only the station's bottom is unobstructed, and that side is mostly protected by the Earth itself.
        </p>
        <p>Anshar Station is shaped roughly like a punctured puck. It is 1 km in diameter, 250 m high, and the anchor shaft pierces the center of it. The top side, facing the lattice, arches shallowly between the central shaft and the outer sides. The side facing Earth arches much more deeply. That side is almost entirely glazed, receiving lots of light from the Earth below.  </p>
        <p>The station rotates to simulate 0.8 g on its outer rim. Every 50 m from the rim to the hub there is a floor ringing the interior. Each successive floor is narrower than the one below, leaving more open space between its edge and the glazing. This allows more of the view to reach more of the interior, and better distribution of the sunlight piped in through clusters of fiberoptic cables bunched around the hub. Sunlight shines down from their outlets. The hub of the station rotates around the shaft of the skyhook a bit slower than once a minute.
        </p>
        <p>Anshar is mostly a workplace. People usually come for stints of between one to five years, but almost nobody moves there to stay. Most people come for work or pleasure, and spend only a few days to a few weeks there.
        </p>

          <summary><h5>Manufacturing on Ashar</h5></summary>
          <p>Several double spheres like the ones at the Gagarin Shipyard are built on top of the lattice. All the manufacturing techniques pioneered on Gagarin are shortly also being done at Anshar. Gagarin concentrates on spacecraft and space construction equipment. Anshar gets into all sorts of things.
          </p>
          <p>As mentioned under Anshar Skyhook, mining of all sorts of metals is profitable at Anshar. As operations expand and economies of scale take hold, even more become profitable. But not much bulk metal is sent to Earth. It is used to make things that are much more valuable, and those things are shipped to Earth - or to the Moon.
          </p>
          <p>Anything that can be made from the materials available in asteroids, can withstand deceleration forces of roughly 10 g, and has a value higher than about US$20 per kg, is a viable option for manufacturing on Anshar. This represents a very wide range of technology.
          </p>
          <p>And here we are only talking about the market for Earth. All sorts of things are both more valuable deeper in space, and cheaper if bought from a company on Anshar instead of an Earth-based competitor. Companies at Gagarin and Cernan's Promise have an advantage here too, of course.

      <summary><h5>Hepit Foot and Anchor Stations</h5></summary>
      <p>Hepit is the 400 metric kiloton foot station of Hepit Skyhook, Earth's launcher skyhook. It is a half dome made of a honeycomb of cells of laminated quartz filled with water, 1.5 m thick, measuring 300 m across and 150 m high at the center. Its floor and internal structures are made of plastic and aluminum alloys reinforced with graphene or CNT. The lower tether of the skyhook pierces the dome at the center, and its cables are used to support a building that spans the middle 100 m of the dome, and extends through its floor. That building descends 100 m below the floor of the dome, and rises to 50 m from the dome itself. Hanging below it are the docks for the craft coming and going from that tether. A tube at the core of that building cuts through the whole dome, so the climber cars can pass through it to reach the docks, load and unload, and transfer people and cargo to the skyhook's anchor station.
      </p>
      <p>On top of the building, and in the whole area around it, is garden and leisure space. There are many swimming pools and sport areas. Hepit Station is a resort more than anything else. Because it moves at a large fraction of orbital velocity, the pull of gravity is only 0.3 g inside it. It orbits every 100 minutes. At its altitude of 100 km, it offers a gorgeous view of the Earth below. With a sunset or a sunrise every 50 minutes, it has an oddly timeless feel. It can accommodate up to 40,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>The foot stations on the launch skyhooks of all the other planets in the network are of a similar overall design, though much smaller. When first built, the mass needed at the foot is just a bunch of rocks, until the proper station can be built.</p>
      <p>Hepit's anchor station is all business, designed almost entirely simply to facilitate traffic between Hepit and Anshar. Most traffic on Hepit is either people or cargo arriving from other worlds and headed to Earth's surface or the manufacturing in the lattice of Anshar, or leaving on the way to other worlds. In all these cases, a hop from Hepit to Anshar, or vice-versa, is involved. Traffic to and from Earth's surface occurs almost exclusively on Anshar. The first waystation on the upper tether is a release point for Hoppers headed to Anshar, that gives them an orbit with an apoapsis at the altitude of its main docks. Hoppers coming in from Anshar release from a similar waystation that gives them a periapsis at the altitude of the anchor docks of Hepit. </p>
      <p>Most of the activity at the station is simply robots moving back and forth in the hollow core of its stone shaft, ferrying cargo and passenger pods. The only bits of it that are pressurized are a few small maintenance modules and an emergency shelter. Three-quarters of the way up the anchor shaft, many bags of Phobos dust are strapped to it. They form almost all the anchor mass of this skyhook. The material is of no mining interest, it is strictly bulk for stabilizing the skyhook.</p>

      <summary><h5>Cylinders</h5></summary>
      <p>As discussed below in Birth of Worlds, O'Neill cylinders are crucial to development across the worlds of the SITH. At Gagarin and Anshar, the superstructure of cylinders for all the surface skyhooks is fabricated by the end of this phase. The Chukwas take them to their destinations, along with the robot crews that assemble them and then complete the construction of the cylinder colonies.</p>
      <p>The first twin-cylinder colony is built on Magnificent Desolation. Like Gagarin, it gets a cylinder that extends south of the tuning-fork shape of the climber docks. In its case, there is another cylinder just the same that extends to the north. Ships are ferried down the upper tether and berthed above the two cylinders. While they are still under construction, many of those ships arrive bearing Phobos dust for their radiation shields. Slag from Gagarin and Anshar is added to the shielding too.</p>
      <p>These are the family cylinders for colonists that are pregnant or have small children, which is discussed in the Children section. As it will take time to truly establish how to ensure the health of these colonists, these cylinders are made as big as possible. It is taken into consideration that they may be needed for colonists whose health can only be aided by constant full gravity, which may include others besides the very young and the pregnant - as the population of the Moon grows, they may need to support many people. Also, they are further greenhouse spaces, providing a buffer to the food supply.
      </p>
      <p>They measure 2 km in diameter and 3 km long, each. The whole interior is open below the 200 m closest to the tethers, which is ring after ring of floors, from the outer wall to the hub, each one experiencing slightly less simulated gravity than the one below. Hills created within the cylinders also have buildings under their overlay of soil and plant life. Most of the inner surface has at least two levels of floor space underneath the forest, grasslands, and gardens receiving the sunlight coming in through the expanse of glazing at the far end of each cylinder.
      </p>
      <p>Crossroads, Sagan, and Babel then all get cylinders like this too. In their case, this is principally for farming, and ecosystem research. Part of their harvests are shipped to Anshar and Hepit, and also to all the other cylinder colonies around other worlds.
      </p>
      <p>To support upcoming development on all the worlds of the SITH, they are all slated to have O'Neill cylinders incorporated into the anchor masses of their surface skyhooks. Work on this begins at the end of this phase and continues afterwards. Ceres and Psyche are included in this drive. Wherever a continuous human presence is being planned, it is best to have such a colony. There is as much industrial activity in space as there is on the surface of these worlds, except for the Moon and of course Earth. In many places, most industry is in space. Cities that will float in the atmosphere of Venus are prepared at the anchor of the surface skyhook and then deployed into the atmosphere bit by bit. Microbes and fungi native to Mars have been found (we shall suppose), and so while they continue to be studied, heavy industry in their environment is forbidden. Instead, machines and habs for the surface are made in orbit and then delivered by the LNCs, and humans are permitted on the surface only in very specific areas, under very specific conditions. Psyche and Ceres have so little gravity, access to the full gravity in the cylinders is important for complete health. The surface of Titan is too hostile for a human habitat. In all these places, the real action is in orbit, on the skyhooks. People who go to these worlds on business usually stay in the cylinders, and may never go to the surface. The cylinders are welcoming, pleasant places thanks to their scale. The lack of time on the worlds below them is not much sacrifice. </p>
