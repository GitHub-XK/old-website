      <summary><h5>End-to-End Robots</h5></summary>
        <p>Robots move from being able to execute a step-by-step plan, to being able to make a plan that will satisfy a set of objectives they have been tasked with fulfilling. The first mega-project they are then tasked with is the construction of Lalande City. The robot team that does it is presented with detailed engineering plans for the city and some parameters for the resources they may use, and told 'go'.
        </p>
        <p>They start by building the new factories for the various materials the city requires. They prototype the robots needed for all the different construction tasks, test them, improve them, and prototype again until they are satisfied they meet suitable standards. Then they build the factories for those robots, and the power plants needed to run them. The first robots stabilize and seal the interior of the crater, prepare the rim with the foundation for the dome that will cover it, and the foundations of all the towers dotted throughout it. The next wave starts building the central towers, and uses them to support the frames of the dome sections. The dome frames and the towers both are slowly expanded, upwards and outwards, until all the towers are their full height and the full armature of the dome is sitting atop them, and the rim structure ringing in the crater. A temporary membrane is used to seal the dome and a thin atmosphere is pumped into the crater, so that the millions of glass sections for the dome can be laid in their frames and built up layer by layer. More power plants are built, and all the infrastructure to supply the city - air, water, thermal control, waste recycling, supplementary greenhouses, telecoms, computation, transit systems, centrifuges, airlocks, lighting, monitoring, emergency services... The city is pressurized up to a full atmosphere and all systems tested.
        </p>
        <p> They lay down topsoil over the crater's interior, setting up terraces and mesh to retain soil on slopes. They plant initial cover crops and test the artificial waterways, the intricate web of irrigation and drainage pipes, and the artificial rain system. Once satisfied, they plant all the trees, bushes, vines, and cacti - anything that lives for years. They build the roads and paths all through the gardens. Humans help a bit during this part, where they want to put in a few personal touches or enjoy the gardening.
        </p>
        <p>At the end of this phase, 15 years after the project started, the city is ready for habitation and rated for a population of a million people. After the main structural part of the building is done, before putting in the glass of the dome, a bunch of robots are sent to build Anshar Station. </p>
        <p>Once all these robots are done, they need to be assigned to something else. They are old hands at city building now, so they are pointed to another crater and instructed to do the same thing there. That next city starts without an initial colony nearby to support the initial phases of the project, or even detailed plans. But that's okay. They figure out how to build that initial base for operations, and how to adapt the previous plans to the new crater. They start turning out a new city every decade, rated for populations of one to two million. If more cities than that are needed, they can of course build more robot teams for that.</p>
        <p>Robots become sort of invisible hands that look after all the details, leaving humans free for creative, intellectual, and spiritual pursuits. They do not develop wills of their own.</p>

      <summary><h5>Lalande City</h5></summary>
        <p>The dome over Lalande Crater is 23 km across on average. The rim ring is 250 m wide, rises 400 m above the rim, and extends 300 m below it. It is heavily reinforced with thick cables that connect to the cables of the dome, and anchor them to the bedrock through shafts at hundreds of points. There are over 80 towers spread throughout the crater that anchor the dome at those points, containing the outward strain of the atmosphere pushing against it. Though the total thickness of the laminated glass of the dome is 3 m, it is still only a fraction of what it would take to counterbalance the pressure of the city's atmosphere. The towers are built around central cores of CNT cable. They are very solid structures of metal, glass, basalt, and composites capable of supporting the dome even if the city loses 95% of its atmosphere. In the center of Lalande they are 5 km tall, near the rim they are 1 km tall. The dome has been built around Cernan's Promise, now it is entirely indoors. It's buildings are preserved for history. </p>
        <p>The towers and rim are where people live in Lalande. The ground is set aside for 'nature'. It has a few facilities for physical activity or public gatherings, but 95% is vegetation or water bodies. Institutional buildings and hospitals are dotted around the crater floor, but they are subterranean, built inside artificial hillocks, hobbit style. Maintenance facilities are all truly subterranean, and inhabited solely by robots. Factories and research facilities are all outside the rim, as are power plants and supplementary greenhouses. Factories are also clustered along the tunnel to the space port 35 km northeast of the city.
        </p>
        <p>Very little of the vegetation is ornamental. It all produces something of value. Trees bear fruit and nuts, bushes are herbals or yield berries, vines have edible roots or fruit, whatever doesn't has medicinal bark, roots, or leaves, or perhaps is a host to a highly valued fungus or edible insect. The ecosystem requires constant adjustment, but only in ways subtle enough that to the untrained eye it is self-sustaining. Small vegetable gardens are scattered all over. Flower plots are set beside path intersections, benches, fountains, and plazas. Small animals and insects live in this groomed wilderness. Some are for food, some are pollinators, some balance the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p> For the most part, it isn't identifiable as farmland, though it all is. The robots don't plant single crops in neat rows, they mix everything together in careful ratios according to what is the best fit for the local soil and terrain, guided by the ecosystem engineers that oversee them. Lush natural ecosystems are imitated as closely as possible. They are able to monitor the environment so carefully that all animals roam free and live pretty natural lives - until it's time to roast them for dinner. In that case, the needed number are promptly captured and cleanly killed. Farming robots work so intimately with the ecosystem they almost seem like part of it. The colonists thus don't refer to it as the gardens or the farms, they call it the countryside.
        </p>
        <p> Once the countryside matures it is able to supply most of the population's food. The air has 2000 ppm carbon dioxide. The rains and irrigation are meted out for best growth. Strings of tiny lights woven into vast nets are carefully spread over everything during the lunar night to provide enough light energy to sustain all the plants. Each patch of these light-blankets provides light for stretches of 8 hours, and then switches off for 16, all through the night. There are no pests, no infections, no droughts, no frost, no storms, and no winter. Most woody plants and vines provide a harvest three times a year. Those harvests are staggered by design so that the supply of fresh prduce is almost constant.
        </p>
        <p> A few key crops are grown in the supplemental greenhouses, mostly grains and legumes. Those greenhouses are completely optimized for maximum yield of whatever crop is in them. The have little free space and feel like factories. For maximum crop density, they are grown in trays that are supplied with sun by fiberoptic cables during the day, and by LEDs at night.
        </p>
        <p>In a similar fashion there are water and air treatment plants that use bacteria and algae to filter out toxins and disease agents. The algae tanks have light piped to them, the bacterial sludge is kept warm with waste heat.</p>
        <p>Broad suspension bridges link the towers, wide enough to be landscaped with gardens of their own and have kiosks and cafes dotted along them. They are spaced every kilometer up the towers. The arches between towers that support the dome also have several levels of walkways hanging beneath them. </p>
        <p>It takes a decade for the population of the city to fill out. While it does, the countryside fills out with it, the trees rising and thickening into forests, moss covering rocks, vines climbing the towers.</p>

      <summary><h5>Power Supply</h5></summary>
        <p>A mix of power sources is developed. Nuclear reactors run on thorium and uranium, solar thermal plants produce power while melting regolith to extract volatiles and produce molten feedstock for production of glasses, ceramics, and metals, microwave rectenna grids receive power from orbital solar wings. Flywheels are used to smooth out the matching of supply and demand.</p>

      <summary><h5>Anshar and Hepit Stations</h5></summary>
        <p>As mentioned in the Anshar Skyhook section, mass is added to the anchor of Anshar as quickly as possible. Much of it arrives as rubble - fragile rubble pile asteroids are intentionally allowed to disintegrate during transport so they are easily mined to extract their carbon and water. The metal asteroid that arrived first and formed the initial anchor during skyhook construction is slowly processed to recover the metals dissolved in the iron that forms 92% of its mass. All of that metal is in high demand, but there is so much iron, and so many of its traditional uses have been taken over by other substances, it has little value. While it is still molten, at the end of the refining process, it is drawn into rods of between 10 and 100 m in length, whose ends are fused together into a gigantic latticework of tetrahedra. This latticework extends outward from a section three-quarters of the way up the enormous stone shaft bridging the center of gravity of the skyhook, where the upper and lower tethers are joined together. It is employed as bulk shelving and support frames for processing and fabrication units that operate within the lattice.
        </p>
        <p>As asteroid material is refined into carbon, water, pure metals, and metal oxides, these products are warehoused in the lattice. Slag, tailings, unused waste rock, and unused particles from gravel to dust, are carefully organized and stored in the lattice too, in case they prove useful later. They are archived according to composition, particle size, and origin. This forms the bulk of the mass of the anchor. A significant fraction of the mass is bags of compacted dust from Phobos.</p>
        <p>The stone shaft is a tube formed of a matrix of slag with fibers of high-strength glass and CNT mixed into it. Cables of CNT also run through it from end to end, and the tethers are fixed to the points where these cables portrude from the ends of the shaft. It is 100 km long and 50 m in diameter, with a hollow core. The section where the iron lattice attaches to it is 5 km long. The center of gravity of the skyhook always stays within this length. It is designed to support any kind of forces either tether could ever be subjected to, and provide rigid support to all the structures built around it. Anshar Anchor Station is tucked under the lattice around it. The latticework is first extended outwards above it so the bulk on it shields the station from radiation and impacts. The lattice turns and extends downwards outside it so that protection is on its sides and top.
        </p>
        <p>Anshar Anchor is the shape of a puck 1 km in diameter and 250 m high. The top and bottom are shallow domes. The bottom is almost entirely glazed, recieving lots of light from the Earth below
