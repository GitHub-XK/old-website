    <h5>Creation of the International Space Agency</h5>
    <p>The agencies of most of the major space-faring nations cooperated in the construction of the International Space Station: ESA, JAXA, Roscosmos, NASA, and CSA. This is the best precedent but is a minor collaboration compared to what would be involved in settling the Moon.</p>
    <p>So the ISA is created and has its own staff, taken from all the member agencies. The founders are the United States, Russia, China, the European Union, India, Japan, and Canada. The agency creates the overall plan and parcels out the work on it. As the United States remains the country with the largest space industry and the most launch facilities, it is headquartered in Florida not far from Kennedy Space Center. </p>
    <p>The construction of the EESS serves as the test case for settling questions of jurisdiction, ownership, information sharing, and legal responsibility. Again the agreements covering the ISS are the model that would need to be built on.</p>
    <p>A shift to an open-source model regarding sharing of the technology developed for the project reduces tensions on several of those issues. A treaty is drawn up for the rest.</p>
    <p>As the project would be underway for a number of years before it involved a permanent human settlement, and a number of years more before there was profit, the scale of cooperation needed to continue working together can ramp up at a manageable pace. A limited-time amendment mechanism for the treaty is used to refine it during its first decade or two of existence.</p>
    <p>The endeavor provides a model for international cooperation that can be applied in many other areas. The sense of shared goals that comes with the undertaking supports the growth of international goodwill. </p>

  <p>By the end of this phase, the Pod Ships have made around 100 trips to lunar orbit, most of them carrying crew for Crossroads. The last trips bring crew for First Hab at the polar base, now dubbed Inukshuk Colony<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#inukshuk">[?]</sup>. First Hab is a permanent structure that houses 40 crew from the ISA nations. That crew is composed of married couples on extended missions of at least 5 years. The ice mines are producing 20 kilotons of water per year. This water supplies all the fuel for the LNCs, the Pod Ships, and the EESS. It has been used to augment the shielding of Crossroads Station and First Hab, and to supply a large fuel depot at the EESS. There were about 200 launches from Earth lifting a total of 10 kilotons of payload to accomplish all this - an average of 13 launches per year. The ISA nations have withdrawn from the Outer Space Treaty and signed a new Space Treaty governing their actions in space. That treaty evolved from the agreements they set up to cover the EESS and their joint lunar ventures, including the amendments that were enacted over the course of this phase.</p>

      While the crew tested the upgraded and new robots on their first sortie at the polar base, they used them to construct several inukshuks - stacks of balanced stones traditionally used as landmarks among Arctic peoples. They made one particularly large one, liked it, and left it standing. Thus the colony acquired its name.
