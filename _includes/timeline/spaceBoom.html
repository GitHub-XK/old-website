    <h1>The Space Boom</h1>
    <p> If not already obvious from some of the grand plans in the previous section, this is the beginning of the Space Boom. Many missions that were previously highly impractical or impossible are now pursued. The possibilities beyond this point are so varied and vast it is hard to make any predictions, other than that everything will change. The scope that Moonwards can cover right now is too small to consider the many projects that would be started at this point. What is here can be considered as a sampling.</p>
    <p>An example for Earth orbit: it makes complete sense that a constellation of skyhook complexes in LEO would shortly be erected, of even greater capacity. Satellite orbits and space debris are now controlled such that there is little collision concern. Several skyhook complexes are placed in near-polar orbits, allowing almost the entirety of common satellite work to be moved to the skyhook stations instead - communications, data transmission, broadcasting, earth observation, mapping and tracking services. So, the tether feet are lowered almost to the Karman line, 100 km above the Earth's surface. </p>
    <p>An example for deep space: automated ships start to fly out to Saturn's rings, where they capture chunks of ice from the rings in giant bags. Saturn's rings are known to consist of 99% pure water ice, and there is no need to mine it, you just bag a bunch of chunks. The ships run on nuclear engines that use a bit of the water as fuel. They don't even split the water into hydrogen and oxygen to get the high I<sub>sp</sub> of liquid hydrogen - they just use water. The engines still have an I<sub>sp</sub> of over 400 seconds, and the ships are cheap to make and hardly need maintenance. Scores of them ply the route between Saturn and Earth, optimizing their trajectories themselves, burning fuel liberally to reduce turnaround time and thus maximize production. The water ice is delivered to the Moon and the space stations, where it is mostly used to create permanent infrastructure: artificial lakes and rivers, transparent shielding over large areas. These ships  bring back 100 kilotons of pure water ice on a single run. One arrives in Lunar or Earth orbit every two weeks. For starters...</p>
    <p>An example for cis-lunar space: an O'Neill cylinder is now practical, on the scale shown in the classic illustrations, a tiny nation-state unto itself. An asteroid of appropriate size and composition is hauled by a super-mega-fetch ship to L5 and work begins.</p>
    <p>Cloud cities above Venus? Colonies on Mars and its moons? Colonies on the terminator of Mercury? On Ceres? On Callisto? Sure! Not all at once, it depends what interests people most, but any of these plans is now feasible. </p>
    <p>I recall an old demonstration i once read showing how little people appreciate the scale of space, that talked about how ridiculously long it would take to evacuate the entire population of Earth. I believe there was some movie around then that depicted that - Titan AE, maybe. It would take a while, but without leaning on fusion power, or carbon nanotubes, or even robots as smart as people (though they get fairly close - behaving rather like savants with severe autism), the systems portrayed here could do that. If there was a century of lead time, our entire population could be moved off the Earth to colonies in space.</p>
