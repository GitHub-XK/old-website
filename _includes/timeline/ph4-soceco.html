      <summary><h5>Children</h5></summary>
      <p> We are conjecturing that a full gravity environment is required at all times for the proper health of unborn children, and that toddlers are slowly able to adapt to lunar gravity for ever longer stretches. It is critical for healthy development of growing children that they maintain a vigorous exercise regimen that includes swimming, physical exercise while in centrifuge environments, and lots of jumping, acrobatics, vertical playgrounds, and lunar parkour. As similar activity remains important for adults too, all this activity is heavily integrated into lunar society and its architecture. Children may need supplements or medicines to help regulate their growth and their bodies, perhaps more so at certain stages of development.
      </p>
      <p>We shall say that children need to sleep in centrifuges under a full gravity, and spend at least an hour a day in them doing some form of exercise. This need is nicely supplied by inflatable centrifuges that are erected and inflated each evening in the courtyards of Lalande City. Each tribe has a courtyard, either on their level of their tower, or in the middle of their collection of houses, if they live in the rim. The interior of these centrifuges is basically a ring-shaped, sideways bouncy castle. The children rarely need any motivation at all to jump around inside them and get up to general shenanigans. In the morning after they wake the centrifuge is stopped, they get out, and it's deflated and stored away until needed again that evening.
      </p>
      <p>They also need to swim pretty much every day. They are taught how while they are infants. Swimming pools are everywhere in the lunar colonies, including a bunch in each tower. This exercise is important for adults too. Families and often whole tribes share the activity. Vertically oriented playgrounds that are scaled-down versions of the ones adults use are dotted throughout the towers as well.
      </p>
      <p>Based on the information we have now (which is very little), this is a reasonable guess as to a physical regimen that would keep kids healthy. The radiation environment in the colonies is as low as on Earth by the time children are present, in that regard there is no concern. However, they would not be allowed to venture outside (in the cab of a surface rover or in a shuttle) unless we know they can tolerate those brief exposures to elevated radiation. Children would be transported to Lalande City from Maggie's cylinders in mother ships once they are old enough, and would not leave until they reach the age research has shown is safe for such things.
      </p>
      <p>The first children appear in the colony in the last two years of this phase. Their parents return with them from Earth when they have reached the age of five. Extensive animals studies in primates and higher mammals such as dogs and cats show this age to be adequate for safety. Initial evaluations are done at Anshar station over a few months to check that everything is in order. The children seem to be able to adapt fine, perhaps after some adjustments are made as to physical routines, diet, and supplements. The families continue on to Cernan's Promise once the medical staff judge the children will be safe if they follow the regimen.
      </p>
      <p>The children are greeted by the tribes with glee. There are only about a hundred in the colony at the end of this phase, when Lalande City opens. Their tribes share the task of raising them, largely because their 'uncles' and 'aunts' insist. There are no tribes that have more than one child, and most have none. Wherever the children go, they are carefully watched over by everyone around them. They thus become really quite confident and trusting.
      </p>
      <p>At the end of this phase, hundreds more families are shortly expected to arrive with children of their own. Pregnant couples are now staying on Magnificent Desolation, near to home and in close contact with their tribe. The tribes are eager to have children in their ranks, and so most of them reorganize so they are smaller, and have space for a few couples planning to have children.

      <summary><h5>Tribal Life</h5></summary>
      <p>Everything is centered around tribes on the Moon. They ensure humanity in a place that is heavily robotized, automated, and computerized. They provide social cohesion in a place composed of a mish-mash of every culture on Earth, while allowing enough autonomy to preserve different ways of life. They prevent authority from becoming concentrated in a place where all the needs of life can only be provided by using a ton of complex technology, which could easily be abused if control was in the hands of few people. From the beginning, tribal organization was fostered in order to keep people looking out for each other and holding together in a dangerous, alien place. Once it seeps into the fundamental fabric of lunar society, it is enshrined as the central pillar of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each year or each month, tribes receive an allotment of robots, food and cargo mass, even a little transit capacity to other colonies and the skyhooks. They use it as they decide among themselves. This is strong incentive for them to learn to make plans as a group, and wrestle through tough decisions. As individuals aren't entitled to any free supplies themselves, and some of these things are expensive to buy (like cargo mass and seats on shuttles), if they can't work with their tribe to get what they want, they aren't going to get it.
      </p>
      <p>Tribes are perfectly free to use their allotments for business. Successful tribes figure out what skills they have and use them together to make a little money. Or a lot of money. Their tribal space is one of the resources that can be important in this - each tribe has a compound that can accommodate a small business or two if cleverly used. How earnings are shared within the tribe is up to them.
      </p>
      <p>There is a catch to this, one a healthy tribe doesn't even notice, and an unhealthy tribe is keenly aware of. Tribe is for life. They can't expel a member. Even if a member commits a serious crime, one for which there is a penalty of confinement - the confinement is with the tribe. It's a form of house arrest, which their own tribe must monitor.
      </p>
      <p>This can cause resentment, but people rarely criticize the system in general. It's better than any alternative that anyone has. That same tribal responsibility also means that people who are aged and need constant care are cared for by their tribe, as are people who have a serious chronic illness. It's a social guarantee. It makes people feel very secure and fosters a sense of social responsibility. Thanks to that guarantee, and the essential guarantee on top of it, tribes vote according to their conscience, not according to any fear they have for the future. This is important to the effective leadership of the colonies.
      <p>
        Once it is time for the colonies to decide how to run the Moon Agency, tribes elect the Moon Agency Director and the Moon Agency Council, who then make decisions during their terms. Each tribe gets one vote. They may decide how they determine their vote - simple majority, consensus, secret ballot, show of hands, whatever Jane says - then it is publicly cast on behalf of the whole tribe. It is like having a huge number of very small constituencies. The dynamics this creates mean that votes are normally considered much more skillfully and thoroughly than voting in other democracies.
      </p>
      <p>Many measures are taken to keep tribes strong, and create new tribes that are strong. The maximum number of people a tribe may have is 50, and the minimum is 40 - a pretty narrow range. Long-standing tribes are permitted to 'adopt' people to maintain balance and variety in their numbers. There must be enough young people to easily look after old people, for instance. Children provide vitality and all tribes want to have a few around. When people marry one partner moves to the tribe of the other partner.
      </p>
      <p>People up for 'adoption' come from tribes with too many people. Those people must choose freely to switch tribes - expulsion isn't allowed under any circumstances. Sometimes a new tribe is made out of handfuls of people from several tribes that have gotten too big.
      </p>
      <p>The private citizens that come in the last rounds of the Residence Program train with a group of people before they come, just like residents always have, and that group becomes their tribe. That's a requirement. The ISA and the MA have become highly skilled at matching people to create good tribes. That skill grows out of the skill space agencies today already have, in putting together teams and training them to act together effectively even under high stress. The training they go through is more about forming social bonds and becoming a team than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>After the Residence Program ends, and immigration begins, the tribe system is maintained by holding those training programs on the Moon itself. Colonists help arriving immigrants organize themselves into groups, and impose a few basic requirements on the makeup of groups. There must be a range of ages and a gender balance, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>If a tribe is really in trouble, it can be disbanded. The members must be picked up by other tribes. Possible reasons could be something like having too many elderly members. This happens with a few of the original tribes, who got complacent and didn't renew themselves enough with young members. A tribe may request disbandment, or it may be imposed on them. When requested, it is not granted lightly. The tribe must go through a long process and in the end the request may be denied.
      </p>
      <p>Tribes receive an incentive package to encourage them to adopt 'strays' without tribe due to disbandment. They are probably going to be a lot of work or difficult to integrate into their group, so incentives are needed. Disbandment is pretty rare, though. Strays start to be a minor phenomenon when immigration begins. Some arriving immigrants want to be part of existing tribes and seek to get adopted by one. Ones with children or planning to have children have no trouble swinging such a deal. The MA doesn't offer incentives in such cases. If an immigrant can't convince a tribe to take them, they usually get placed in a new tribe like most immigrants. Sometimes the MA decides to offer an incentive package for a mature tribe to take them, if they see trouble ahead with them.

      <summary><h5>The Economy</h5></summary>
      <p>Businesses and projects the Moon participates in now provide a large chunk of Earth's electrical power, and most of its communications, surveillance, and observations of all kinds, from weather to traffic. All of these markets are large and highly profitable.
      </p>
      <p>Many of humanity's most talented roboticists now live on the Moon or work closely with Moon projects. The Moon is robotics heaven. The robotics knowledge acquired through lunar development is open source, but the Moon still makes a lot of money on it. The Moon exports high-end robots to businesses doing manufacturing in Earth orbit. Moon residents form their own companies doing the same thing. Now that Anshar is complete, manufactured goods from orbit are far more competitive, so that is a huge market. The Moon both provides most of the robots working on Anshar, and thanks to the price drop for delivery to Earth Anshar provides, now sells a lot of robots to companies on Earth itself.
      </p>
      <p>Software for robots, and software in general, remains a gigantic market. Programming of advanced robots is a very carefully regulated business in which lunar colonists form a large percentage of the top people. They are paid extremely well for these services when contracted, and launch a number of companies specializing in it.
      </p>
      <p>The Moon Agency and the Moon Fund have a slice of almost everything happening in space. New enterprises seeking to enter the field are wise to play ball with them and the ISA. The more people move into space, and the more infrastructure on other worlds develops, the more this snowballs.
      </p>
      <p>The Moon is crammed with very wealthy people who hold as central values that all people deserve the basics of life and it's best for everyone to ensure everyone has them. They believe in a close-knit society which also accommodates a wide range of cultures and lifestyles. They are, both individually and collectively, highly influential. The Moon is now a seat of power.
