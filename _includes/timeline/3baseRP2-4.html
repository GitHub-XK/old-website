    <h5>The Equatorial Skyhook becomes Gagarin Station</h5>
    <p>
    The asteroid is mined, and as material from it is sent down to Cernan's Promise, components for a space station are sent back up, plus gravel and rocks to maintain or increase its mass. This space station will expand over time to fill certain economic niches:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>Microgravity Manufacturing</h6> with the Moon colonies there to send up raw materials and manufactured items, the asteroid is a good place for this. Perhaps if lunar material can be used to produce cheap enough heat shields, it would even be possible to send certain goods to Earth's surface within a budget that made sense, by releasing them from the upper tether on a trajectory that skims Earth's atmosphere. </li>
      <li><h6>Staging area for deep-space missions</h6> As the manufacturing of space infrastructure grows as an industry at Cernan's Promise, it becomes valuable to assemble the final ship and payload for many deep-space missions at Gagarin. Only the things that can't be produced on the Moon need to come from Earth. Once ready, the ships are given a significant speed boost by the launch from the upper tether, allowing them to get quickly on their way.</li>
      <li><h6>Shipyard</h6> Extending the previous idea, final assembly and outfitting of components from Cernan's Promise to produce whole spaceships is done at the asteroid. Some parts need to come from Earth, but not a lot. Nuclear thermal and nuclear electric ships are built. Also solar sail ships. These kinds of ships would gain even more advantage than other designs through launch-release from the upper tether. Nuclear thermal ships can avoid firing engines where the radiation spray could damage installations on the asteroid surface, low-thrust solar sail and nuclear electric ships save a ton of time by avoiding the need to break orbit themselves. </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Expansion of the Lunar Fleet</h5>
    <p><h6>3 More Nuclear Shuttles and 3 More Pod Ships</h6> Let us estimate that many are needed for an agile fleet by the end of this period. They may need to be larger than the first ones. These are simply to support Gagarin, the shipyard, and the Residence Program. They also transport some official visitors and a modest number of tourists.</p>
    <p><h6>Asteroid Fetch Ships</h6> Several are launched by private companies. The Moon Agency enforces regulations on these activities and has jurisdiction to seize the ships if necessary, or may take a range of lesser actions.</p>
    <p><h6>Space Tugs</h6> Several also start to operate out of Gagarin Station under private operation. They service satellites or salvage dead ones, and deliver ones made at Cernan's Promise to their orbits. The MA regulates these too.</p>
    <p><h6>Agency Ships</h6>Two small, powerful nuclear ships are built, which stay docked at Gagarin, there if needed. They are mostly for the purpose of rescue operations, but also send the message that if the MA decides to seize your ship, it can. Like everything else, they can pilot themselves, but they have pressurized cabins sufficient for a small crew.</p>

    <h5>Construction of Cernan's Promise</h5>
    <p>It goes on the East rim of Lalande Crater, and uses Lalande's mineral wealth to create an extensive construction industry. It is named Cernan's Promise in rememberance of the last words spoken on the Moon, by Gene Cernan: 'We leave as we came and God willing as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind'.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>First Hab and Other Prep</h6>The initial hab is built, for the construction crew who then become the senior staff. So it is also called First Hab. The surrounding area is paved. A nuclear generator is set up in a small crater near the site. A set of MIP stations, and an initial basalt fiber production facility specializing in cable are made and used in the First Hab construction. It is designed for a staff of 40 people. Once completed, that staff takes up residence and oversees further construction.</li>
      <li><h6>Construction Stages</h6>These are the buildings and infrastructure portrayed in <a href="colonies.html#Phase1_Overview">this 3d model</a>. Cernan's Promise is by far the most developed virtual colony right now. Most of the items in the list are labelled there with the names referred to here. This is roughly the stages in which they are built:
      <ol>
        <li>Solar thermal power plant (TESS phase 1), full-scale basalt fiber production unit, initial industrial hangar with first dust-roasters, vacuum deposition furnace, 3d printers, and cryogenic storage area </li>
        <li>Big atrium, gallery (phase 1), beginning of glass production, first fluidized bed reactors</li>
        <li>Large hangar with minimal atmosphere, 2nd standard hangar, TESS phase 2, first sports hab, extend upper gallery, south long atrium, proper spaceport</li>
        <li>Complete upper gallery, 2nd TESS on hilltop, south hangar cluster, north long atrium </li>
        <li>Teacup crater, lower gallery with sports habs and bottom dome</li>
        <li>Mega-atrium</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is achieved quickly because the robots are continually upgraded, more are shipped in or built, and they become able to do more and more without supervision. One of the fabrication lines built in the hangars of stage 3 manufactures robots that are added to the workforce, as well as some being sent to Gagarin. They need only a few circuit boards, sensors, motors, and actuators from Earth to go to work. The construction of all these things only takes 7 years, even as the factories of CP also send structures and equipment to other expanding settlements.</p>
    <h5>Commerce and Industry at Cernan's Promise</h5>
    <p>In the hangars around CP, many things are built - parts for satellites, space ships, space stations, skyhook components, and robotic machinery for space and for the Moon. At first the revenue from this is small, as the production mostly goes to projects of the ISA and the Moon Agency, but it grows quickly. The structures built in stages 5 and 6 are used to host myriad events that boost broadcasting revenue, which is an important income, and for tourism, which is a minor revenue stream but important for more general social reasons. These structures are the outstanding features making people flock to move to the Moon after the end of the RP. </p>
    <h5>Gagarin Station</h5>
    <p>Even as all the above is happening, components for Gagarin Station are are also made and shipped out - tanks, trusses, frames, hulls, windows, arms, rails. Similar components are made and sent to expand the ISS, plus bulk regolith shielding, and a large tank of water. A few satellites are made and placed in orbit.</p>
    <h5>Expansion of Inukshuk Colony</h5>
    <p>As the population grows, more greenhouses are needed. Ice mining also expands, now being done in a whole set of craters. The ice mining is now almost completely automated. The population at Inukshuk levels off at 1000 people, and everyone else goes to Lalande. </p>
  </article>
  <article class="column" id="RPround2-4">
    <h5>Residence Program rounds 2 through 4</h5>
    <p>Total population at the completion of these events is 3200 people - 3000 from the RP, and 200 from the ISA nations who continue to administer the colonies. </p>
    <p><h6>The Moon Agency</h6> is created at this point, and staff is extended beyond the existing management staff to include some of the residents. The MA oversees colony activity beyond this point, following the dictates of a treaty created to establish its policies.</p>
    <p><h6>Cultural Impact Back Home</h6>Some programming broadcast from the colonies becomes quite popular on Earth. Certain sports have evolved into something unique and entertaining, and there are now leagues of small competing teams, and scheduled matches for several sports that include annual championships. A sort of variety talk show has also become very popular. An annual arts event gets considerable attention and includes virtual participation by people on Earth. Many of the video blogs of different resident groups have large loyal followings. The lunar population includes a number of people who have become international celebrities, and even more who are major celebrities in their home countries.</p>
    <h5>The Moon Fund and Opening of the Economy</h5>
    <p>The lunar economy nears break even during these events, which triggers a set of pre-agreed actions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Moon Fund is created and all lunar finances from existing industry then go through it. How profits from that are distributed, once they exist, becomes a very delicate matter. The situation was forseen, but the particulars couldn't be predicted, so there is a lot of haggling about the details.</li>
      <li>At the end of Round 4, the most robust industries are privatized. Others will be privatized as they reach certain milestones. Transport and telecommunications infrastructure, and all other infrastructure judged vital to the health and safety of the residents, continues to be held in common and governed by the Moon Agency.</li>
      <li>Privatizations follow a standard procedure. Each privatized installation becomes a publicly traded corporation with a set of bylaws which may be expanded, but may not be changed or removed, and which are binding.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h6>Cooperative Dynamics</h6>Privatization does not change the contract made with the RP astronauts that their needs are covered for life, nor would it make sense to change that arrangement. They still raise the crops, do the maintenance and repairs - they do everything that keeps the colonies functioning, including looking after transport, power, and telecoms infrastructure that, starting at the end of Round 4, now goes partly to provide services to private companies. All colony resources are essentially held in common, as far as providing for the people there goes.</p>
    <p><h6>Informal Economy</h6>As time goes on, there are increasing numbers of deals between residents for goods and services that are extras. There is barter, and sometimes exchanges of funds between Earth-side accounts, which are then used to have extra luxury items delivered. It is usually used for favorite foods, extra clothing, and small furnishings. Towards the end of this period, the freedom of residents to have contracts with entities on Earth and be paid increases, and the wealth of some residents suddenly increases as a result.</p>
