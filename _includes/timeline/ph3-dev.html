    <summary><h5>Robotics and AI</h5></summary>
    <p>This is the point where the sophistication of artificial intelligence allows robots to perform many tasks without any human oversight. They can be taught to do almost any task done by people in industrial jobs today, as long as it is fairly repetitive and predictable. Once they have learned, they alert a human only when some unforeseen event prevents them from continuing. They are capable of working in teams, coordinating what they do with other robots.</p>
    <p>This capability is what allows the interplanetary missions to be done on such large scales. In almost all cases, the missions are executed by artificial intelligences and robots. They don't wait for further instructions from people on Earth or the Moon every time they finish some simple movement, like rovers today. They complete entire projects almost on their own. They have blueprints in their memory for a long series of points in the construction of the space elevators on Phobos and Ceres, for instance. They figure out how to reach each point in that series, so the construction matches the blueprint, using the library of routines they have. The space elevators and other such things have been designed for easy deployment on site, same as equipment to be installed on the ISS is today, but this still requires very complex behavior and problem solving.</p>
    <p>This capacity speeds up development in space dramatically. It's why so many things get done during this phase, and later phases are exponentially more active again. Factories are built that manufacture entire vehicles and robots almost by themselves, staffed with robotic machinery. The raw materials that are used in those factories arrive from other factories that are almost as automated. As long as the robots operate in a predictable environment, they can do almost anything. By the end of Phase 3 many items and pieces of equipment are made completely of lunar materials, by lunar machines. Only very sophisticated and delicate machines come from Earth, such as computers and view screens.</p>

    <summary><h5>Cernan's Promise</h5></summary>
    <p>The colony built on the eastern rim of Lalande Crater will house 1600 people by the end of this phase. Plans for a town for 50,000 people, surrounded by the factories that form the core of lunar industry, have been carefully drawn up and are methodically executed even as industry ramps up. The residents participate in construction of the factories and the town, but mostly that is handled by robots on their own. People focus on research, design, and planning of industries for Cernan's Promise. As soon as possible, the first factories at CP begin building modules and equipment for spacecraft, space stations, robots, satellites, and tether facilities.</p>

      <summary>Construction of Initial Habs, Factories, Hangars, and Mines</summary>
     <ul>
       <li>A remotely operated set of equipment excavates a pit and builds the first habitat inside it. That habitat is an atrium design with a radiation blind roof. A team of 20 people moves into that hab and oversees continuing construction.</li>
       <li>The surface near the habitat is paved, including the landing pad for the LNCs, connected by a road to the hab area.</li>
       <li> A microwave rectenna is built to provide power to the new colony. It receives microwaves beamed from the skyhooks. A set of flywheels are built for short-term power storage when no skyhooks are beaming power, and for added power during heavy loads. Further flywheels are added as needed. The rectenna is sized to receive far more power than it does for the first while. Over time the energy in the beam is increased. </li>
       <li> An airless hangar is built that houses a repair and maintenance station, a set of dust roasters producing pure metals, and a series of machines that turn that into components: 3d printers, casting equipment, welders. The hangar has a lot of extra space where machinery can be stored at night, and large pieces can be produced by combining structures made in the MIPs and the metal-working machines.</li>
       <li>On the open surface, a series of MIP stations, solar furnaces, and chemical reactors are built. Some of the reactors are multi-stage processes in their own sheds. More of all of these are built throughout this phase, to support the factories and hangars with a range of supplies, and support continuing construction.</li>
       <li>A factory with a thin atmosphere is built and filled with glass fiber equipment. Unlike hangars, factories have internal divisions, including multiple floors, columns, and internal walls. This factory produces short fibers and thread made of different kinds of glass, and from that, fabric, cable, nets, batting, and bulk fibers for composite materials. Some of that is made of simple basalt, some is aluminosilicate glass, or has other glass formulas. Composite materials in simple shapes are made with molds, presses, or rollers: pipes, rods, panels, containers, rings.</li>
       <li>The excavation for the galleries and the atriums is all done. Some sections were blasted out during earlier exploration missions.</li>
       <li>Previously identified ore deposits start to be mined. There is a spot in the central peak, and another far down the south wall, that are particularly high in KREEP elements. These deposits are tunnelled into by blasting. </li>
       <li>A STeP is built for bulk processing of regolith to purify a range of chemicals, produce bulk molten regolith, and provide extra power.</li>
       <li>The upper gallery and the north atrium hab are built.</li>
       <li>A multi-storey airless factory is built. On the ground floor is bulk production of transparent glass, in panes of varying thickness, profile, and shape. It also produces Fresnel, convex, and concave lenses.</li>
       <li>The 2nd floor takes glass panes from the ground floor and prints photovoltaics and circuitry onto them. Its output of solar cells is assembled into panels and shipped to Inukshuk and the skyhooks.</li>
       <li>The 3rd floor is set up for production of Zylon. It contains a number of reactors that turn the carbon chemicals from asteroids and lunar deposits into precursor chemicals for Zylon. Once the complex polymer that constitutes Zylon is made, it is carefully spun into high-quality fibers and threads. These are then made into cables, that are woven into components for the skyhooks.</li>
      <li>That floor also houses specialized reactor chambers for making silicone polymers.</li>
      <li>The 4th floor has reactors producing panes, tubes, lenses, prisms, and domes of pure quartz and sapphire. It also has facilities for drawing molten silica into optical fibers.</li>
       <li>A silo is set up for bulk production of topsoil.</li>
       <li>A small factory structure is built in a pit and a production line for explosives set up in it.
       <li>The lower gallery is built, the tube habs are added to both galleries.</li>
       <li>The south atrium is built, and Teacup crater is covered with glazing and sealed.</li>
       <li>A 2nd, larger STeP is built.</li>
       <li>A big hangar is built for more advanced assembly of components, producing entire robots and vehicles, and a range of machinery.</li>
       <li>Larger factories producing all of the products listed above are built clustered around that hangar, making larger quantities, with more variety and better quality.</li>
       <li>The long dome hab near the crater floor is built.</li>
       </ul>

    <summary><h5>Greenhouses at Inukshuk</h5></summary>
    <p>The earlier greenhouse design is extended to versions that have three domes clustered around a central mirror that reflects light in such that for 8 hours each gets full light, 8 hours of a dim twilight, and 8 hours of darkness. Six such tri-part greenhouses are built clustered around a central tower that provides a mirror for each that concentrates enough light on their distributing mirrors for optimum growth. That tower is a kilometer tall and is fitted with six mirrors 120 m in diameter, each on an arm that positions it above its corresponding greenhouse cluster. The arms spiral around the central support tower so that no mirror even blocks another. The only shadow that falls on the mirrors is the narrow one from the tower itself. Over the day, each mirror rotates to follow the sun. Each of the three domes in the tri-part clusters is 180 m across. In the center, these domes are 30 m higher than at the rim, and the ground within is a bowl shape 20 m lower in the center than at the rim. </p>
    <p>Five of the greenhouse clusters are interconnected, and there are work rooms in the spaces between them. The last one is isolated from the others by an airlock. This one is an extension of the earlier project to create a stable ecosystem that needs no external input to continue growing. The whole set of greenhouses is about 3 kilometers away from the other buildings and has to be accessed by rovers with pressurized cabs, or in space suits. The airlock for the whole complex will fit the largest rover, and inside that has a pressurized garage that will fit several such vehicles.</p>
    <p>Although food production (and medicinal plants) continues to be the top priority of the greenhouses, each set of three is tweaked to have a different climate that favors different ecosystems. A small set of animals is present in each, mostly insects, but also some fish, some reptiles, a few birds, and a few small mammals. The animals all roam free, though their populations must be carefully controlled. An effort is made to create populations that balance each other as much as possible to minimize the need for interference and mutually reinforce the health of all the species present.</p>

    <summary><h5>Gagarin Station - O'Neill cylinders and the Shipyard</h5></summary>
    <p>For this phase, the north and south halves of Gagarin Station are specialized for two separate activities. The north half is the shipyard, part of which is microgravity manufacturing facilities. The south half is the first O'Neill cylinder, providing a large, full gravity habitat. The core of the station is the tuning-fork shape that bends around the Zylon-reinforced stone shaft that joins the upper and lower tethers, where the climbers dock. That piece is aligned along the east-west axis, with the tether running between the two posts of the fork, going up and down. </p>
    <p>Attached to the north side of the fork is a double sphere, one nested inside the other. The inner sphere contains a thin atmosphere of argon, for manufacturing processes that benefit from a gas medium, either for removing heat or providing some pressure. The outer sphere is covered to provide a space with a controlled temperature (out of sunlight), reduced radiation, and where loose items remain contained. The inner sphere is 200 m across, and the outer sphere is 300 m across.</p>
    <p>The sphere has a ring of trusses around it that extend north, forming a long cylinder mostly open on the sides. Above and below it are great solar cell wings, docks extend from it east and west from its mid-line. The far north end of the cylinder is open. That is the mouth of the construction bay, which is the whole space within that tube, down to where the sphere begins. It can fit an object up to 300 m across and 800 m long. Or, that is the largest structure that can be built inside it. </p>
    <p>The south post of the central fork is quite a bit fatter than the north one. The whole fork is pressurized. As well as being the structural support that integrates the shipyard and the O'Neill cylinder with the skyhook, it is where all the airlocks are. The south post has an airlock on the bottom 5 m across, it is where passenger pods are normally mated so people can enter the fork and from there enter the cylindrical hab. The end of that post has a much larger airlock 20 m across, which is where the largest cargo pods are mated, to bring in large objects or unload a high volume of goods. There is a big, sturdy ring joint near the base of that post, aligned with the tether. It is about 30 m in diameter and 30 m long. The whole cylinder south of that spins around that joint, completing one turn about every 30 seconds.</p>
    <p>South of that ring the shallow north dome of the O'Neill cylinder stretches away, to a total span of 250 m. It is 350 m long and has another shallow dome capping its south end. The south dome is glazed across the middle 180 m of the span. The panes are hexagons 8 m across made of 6 laminated sheets that together are 15 cm thick. The middle 40 m is the span that forms a giant Fresnel lens. It is there that the mirror outside the south end passes sunlight into the cylinder, which the Fresnel lens spreads out so it falls evenly over the inner cylinder walls. </p>
    <p>The landscape surface of the cylinder, the one that faces the 'sky' - being the open space in the core of the cylinder - gets slowly covered with soil to a depth of one meter. A shell structure is placed around the north end of the cylinder, its sides, and the unglazed outer portion of the south end. That shell doesn't rotate, it is fixed to the fork. It is built up over time to a thickness of 3.5 m of gravel, rock, and regolith. The south cap of the shell is closed in with glass cells filled with water, forming a barrier 3 m thick. All this work extends a few years into the next phase, as 3.1 megatons of rock is involved. The mass for the shell mostly comes from asteroids, the water for the end cap mostly comes from the Moon. Once it is complete, the radiation within the hab is low enough for life-long habitation.</p>
    <p>Provided they have that level of radiation shielding, O'Neill cylinder habitats may be critical to space settlement. It depends on how well people can adapt to a low gravity environment. It may be necessary for long-term health that people either live in, or spend a large proportion of their time in, a full gravity or something close to it. If that is the case, it may not be possible to have a full life living on the Moon, and true human communities would have to exist in orbit, in these cylinders, which are spun so that centrifugal force imitates Earth gravity on their inner walls.<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#gravPrescrip">[?]</sup>Later in the timeline, these cylinders will be the homes of pregnant couples and children under three.</p>
    <div class="tooltip_templates">
      <span id="gravPrescrip">
    We know people can <a href="http://time.com/4371495/scott-kelly-space-body/">remain healthy</a> for at least a year in microgravity if they follow a careful exercise routine. At this point it is sheer speculation how well people would adapt to living permanently in low gravity, if they maintain all of the health routines that the colonies have been designed to support. It is reasonable to have confidence we can live for years in good health in such conditions, but we can't say if health problems would crop up after some number of years and possibly be serious. Lacking data, this project supposes that there will be no problems that can't be handled without much trouble. The area where skepticism about this is highly warranted is pregnancy and childhood, as noted.</span>

    <summary><h5>Gagarin Station - Asteroid Mining Arrives</h5></summary>
    <p>The time needed to return an asteroid to a skyhook is greatly reduced by the team effort of the Fetchers, Hoppers, and the nuclear Pod ship. Small targets under 3 kilotons are very commonly available and quick to retrieve, so they still make up the bulk of targets. In most cases, they can be returned and docked at a skyhook in 6 to 20 weeks. Large targets are retrieved twice, in one case a carbonaceous asteroid massing 50 kilotons, and in one case a metal asteroid massing 60 kilotons. In all, 100 asteroids are returned for mining, with a total mass of 250 kilotons.</p>
    <p>Units to process ore by heating or melting it, and reacting it, are sent up from Cernan's Promise. The rocky material in the asteroids, which is similar to lunar regolith, is generally considered worthless except as radiation shielding. If it is high enough in silica or alumina, that may be refined out for glass, quartz, or sapphire production on site. Other stone is simply added to the exterior of the cylinder hab of Gagarin unless it has a high enough content of hydrated minerals or valuable metals to be worth processing. Carbonaceous asteroids are processed for carbon, water, and volatiles. Metal asteroids, and other asteroids with metal bits, are processed for iron, nickel, cobalt, platinum group metals, and semiconductors. The iron is mostly stockpiled - there's just too much of it, as it has been replaced in most applications by other options that are lighter, stronger, or both.</p>
    <p>By the end of this phase, there is enough experience, and the spotting telescopes have advanced enough, to pick out the very best targets - with a high content of metals, carbon, or water. The Fetchers only go out after those. If an odd or rare asteroid is spotted, and it is small enough, it is retrieved for study, at Sagan Station. </p>

    <summary><h5>Power From Space</h5></summary>
    <p>As mentioned above, the first factory built at Cernan's Promise in part produces solar cells, and more such factories are built at an accelerating rate once the infrastructure for that starts accumulating. From the beginning, part of that output goes to solar power arrays being built in Earth orbit. The cells are sent up to Gagarin, where they are assembled and placed on trusses, and connected to a very large microwave transmitter. Thrusters, radio dishes, control units, batteries, and any other needed kit is installed on the trusses. Finally, the Pod ships take the units to their geostationary orbits, assembles them, and deploys them.
    </p>
    <p>These units then beam power to Earth. Receiving stations on Earth convert the microwaves to electricity. It's the same technology as the power beamed from the skyhooks to the colonies. For it to work for Earth, the nations receiving the power need to arrange for the right microwave spectrum to be available - 5.8 GHz - and for the beams to not cause interference with any other microwave spectrum use around the ground receivers.
    </p>
    <p>Ground receivers have to be quite large in order to receive the power as a beam weak enough for it not to affect weather or plant and animal life. The receivers are essentially grids of wires, a mesh that is mostly open to the sky, so they can be placed almost anywhere without interfering with anything below. The likeliest option is over farmland. There needs to be many such receivers to get enough power to provide a large fraction of a nation's needs.
