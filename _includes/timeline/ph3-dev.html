    <summary><h5>Robotics and AI</h5></summary>
    <p>This is the point where the sophistication of artificial intelligence allows robots to perform many tasks without any human oversight. They can be taught to do almost any task done by people in industrial jobs today, as long as it is fairly repetitive and predictable. Once they have learned, they alert a human only when some unforeseen event prevents them from continuing. They are capable of working in teams, coordinating what they do with other robots.</p>
    <p>This capability is what allows the interplanetary missions to be done on such large scales. In almost all cases, the missions are executed by aritificial intelligences and robots. They don't report back to people on Earth or the Moon every time they have done some simple movement, like rovers today. They complete entire projects almost on their own. They have blueprints in their memory for a long series of points in the construction of the space elevators on Phobos and Ceres, for instance. They figure out how to reach each point in that series, so the construction matches the blueprint, using the library of routines they have. The space elevators and other such things have been designed for easy deployment on site, same as equipment to be installed on the ISS is today, but this still requires very complex behavior and problem solving.</p>
    <p>This capacity speeds up development in space dramatically. It's why so many things get done during this phase, and later phases are exponentially more active again. Factories are built that manufacture entire vehicles and robots almost by themselves, staffed with robotic machinery. The raw materials that are used in those factories arrive from other factories that are almost as automated. As long as the robots operate in a predictable environment, they can do almost anything. By the end of Phase 3 many items and pieces of equipment are made completely of lunar materials, by lunar machines. Only very sophisticated and delicate machines come from Earth, such as computers and viewscreens.</p>

    <summary><h5>Cernan's Promise</h5></summary>
    <p>The colony built on the eastern rim of Lalande Crater will house 800 people by the end of this phase. Plans for a town for 50,000 people, surrounded by the factories that form the core of lunar industry, have been carefully drawn up and are methodically executed even as industry ramps up. The residents participate in construction of the factories and the town, but mostly that is handled by robots on their own. People focus on research, design, and planning of industries for Cernan's Promise. As soon as possible, the first factories at CP begin building modules and equipment for spacecraft, space stations, robots, satellites, and tether facilities.</p>

      <summary>Construction of Initial Habs, Factories, Hangars, and Mines</summary>
     <ul>
       <li>A remotely operated set of equipment excavates a pit and builds the first habitat inside it. That habitat is an atrium design with a radiation blind roof. A team of 20 people moves into that hab and oversees continuing construction.</li>
       <li>The surface near the habitat is paved, including the landing pad for the LNCs, connected by a road to the hab area.</li>
       <li> A microwave rectenna is built to provide power to the new colony. It receives microwaves beamed from the skyhooks. A set of flywheels are built for short-term power storage when no skyhooks are beaming power, and for added power during heavy loads. Further flywheels are added as needed. The rectenna is sized to receive far more power than it does for the first while. Over time the energy in the beam is increased. </li>
       <li> An airless hangar is built that houses a repair and maintenance station, a set of dust roasters producing pure metals, and a series of machines that turn that into components: 3d printers, casting equipment, welders. The hangar has a lot of extra space where machinery can be stored at night, and large pieces can be produced by combining structures made in the MIPs and the metal-working machines.</li>
       <li>On the open surface, a series of MIP stations, solar furnaces, and chemical reactors are built. Some of the reactors are multi-stage processes in their own sheds. More of all of these are built throughout this phase, to support the factories and hangars with a range of supplies, and support continuing construction.</li>
       <li>A factory with a thin atmosphere is built and filled with glass fiber equipment. Unlike hangars, factories have internal divisions, including multiple floors, columns, and internal walls. This factory produces short fibers and thread made of different kinds of glass, and from that, fabric, cable, nets, batting, and bulk fibers for composite materials. Some of that is made of simple basalt, some is aluminosilicate glass, or has other glass formulas. Composite materials in simple shapes are made with molds, presses, or rollers: pipes, rods, panels, containers, rings.</li>
       <li>The excavation for the galleries and the atriums is all done. Some sections were blasted out during earlier exploration missions.</li>
       <li>Previously identified ore deposits start to be mined. There is a spot in the central peak, and another far down the south wall, that are particularly high in KREEP elements. These deposits are tunnelled into by blasting. </li>
       <li>A STeP is built for bulk processing of regolith to purify a range of chemicals, produce bulk molten regolith, and provide extra power.</li>
       <li>The upper gallery and the north atrium hab are built.</li>
       <li>An multi-storey airless factory is built. On the ground floor is bulk production of transparent glass, in panes of varying thickness, profile, and shape. It also produces Fresnel, convex, and concave lenses.</li>
       <li>The 2nd floor takes glass panes from the ground floor and prints photovoltaics and circuitry onto them. Its output of solar cells is assembled into panels and shipped to Inukshuk and the skyhooks.</li>
       <li>The 3rd floor is set up for production of Zylon. It contains a number of reactors that turn the carbon chemicals from asteroids and lunar deposits into precursor chemicals for Zylon. Once the complex polymer that constitutes Zylon is made, it is carefully spun into high-quality fibers and threads. These are then made into cables, that are woven into components for the skyhooks.</li>
      <li>That floor also houses specialized reactor chambers for making silicone polymers.</li>
      <li>The 4th floor has reactors producing panes, tubes, lenses, prisms, and domes of pure quartz and sapphire</li>
       <li>A silo is set up for bulk production of topsoil.</li>
       <li>A small factory structure is built in a pit and a production line for explosives set up in it.
       <li>The lower gallery is built, the tube habs are added to both galleries.</li>
       <li>The south atrium is built, and Teacup crater is covered with glazing and sealed.</li>
       <li>A 2nd, larger STeP is built.</li>
       <li>A big hangar is built for more advanced assembly of components, producing entire robots and vehicles, and a range of machinery.</li>
       <li>Larger factories producing all of the products listed above are built clustered around that hangar, making larger quantities, with more variety and better quality.</li>
       <li>The long dome hab near the crater floor is built.</li>
       </ul>

    <summary><h5>Greenhouses at Inukshuk</h5></summary>
    <p>The earlier greenhouse design is extended to versions that have three domes clustered around a central mirror that reflects light in such that for 8 hours each gets full light, 8 hours of a dim twilight, and 8 hours of darkness. Six such tri-part greenhouses are built clustered around a central tower that provides a mirror for each that concentrates enough light on their distributing mirrors for optimum growth. That tower is a kilometer tall and is fitted with six mirrors 120 m in diameter, each on an arm that positions it above its corresponding greenhouse cluster. The arms spiral around the central support tower so that no mirror even blocks another. The only shadow that falls on the mirrors is the narrow one from the tower itself. Over the day, each mirror rotates to follow the sun. Each of the three domes in the tri-part clusters is 180 m across. In the center, these domes are 30 m higher than at the rim, and the ground within is a bowl shape 20 m lower in the center than at the rim. </p>
    <p>Five of the greenhouse clusters are interconnected, and there are work rooms in the spaces between them. The last one is isolated from the others by an airlock. This one is an extension of the earlier project to create a stable ecosystem that needs no external input to continue growing. The whole set of greenhouses is about 3 kilometers away from the other buildings and has to be accessed by rovers with pressurized cabs, or in space suits. The airlock for the whole complex will fit the largest rover, and inside that has a pressurized garage that will fit several such vehicles.</p>
    <p>Although food production (and medicinal plants) continues to be the top priority of the greenhouses, each set of three is tweaked to have a different climate that favors different ecosystems. A small set of animals is present in each, mostly insects, but also some fish, some reptiles, a few birds, and a few small mammals. The animals all roam free, though their populations must be carefully controlled. An effort is made to create populations that balance each other as much as possible to minimize the need for interference and mutually reinforce the health of all the species present.</p>
