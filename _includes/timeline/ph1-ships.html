    <h5>Construction of the Earth Equatorial Space Station</h5>
    <p>Because of the scale and nature of the work that happens on this station, it is built in an equatorial orbit. These orbits never pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly, so the radiation exposure of people on the station is a fraction of what crews on the ISS get. This architecture has been extensively explored by <a href="http://alglobus.net/">Al Globus et al.</a>. The station is the proving grounds for tele-operated robotic construction. Successful development of that and cost savings from reusable launch vehicles allows creation of a space station on a much grander scale than the current International Space Station. Progress in AI, tele-robotics, and in-situ lunar resource processing allow later materials to be obtained from the Moon.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>What the EESS includes</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>An area for on-orbit assembly of the ships that will go to the Moon (the Pod Ships and the Lunar Nuclear Craft). This area is also the base for assembling the Station modules and components delivered from Earth. It is the first thing built
          - a hexagon of trusses all connected to a central module. </li>
        <li>Aside from being the construction area, the hexagonal truss area is where automated ships berth, cargo pods are moored, and robots are stored. Bits and pieces get tacked onto it while things are being built or repaired, satellites or probes are
          being prepared for deployment, or equipment flying experiments do their work. We shall call it the Hexagon.</li>
        <li>The Hub starts as the initial module at the center of the Hexagon and then grows outwards in one direction. Large tanks for water brought from the Moon, and equipment to crack it into hydrogen and oxygen, liquefy that, and store it until it is
          used to fill the fuel tanks of ships, is clustered around that module.</li>
        <li>Further modules extending the Hub house all the key infrastructure for the Station - power conversion and distribution, cooling, air tanks, air scrubbers, airlocks and docks for crewed ships, tools, sensors, comms equipment, and initial crew quarters.
          </li>
        <li>Then, a rotating flattened Torus is added, for a simulated gravity environment. The torus is large enough to accommodate both crew quarters and labs doing a range of research on low-gravity. It has several greenhouse spaces and sections for animal experiments. Its outer rim experiences centrifugal force equivalent to the gravity on Mars, while the top floor of its torus is like lunar gravity. The hub contains a lab for micro-gravity experiments.</li>
        <li>Finally, 4 Teardrops are added to the torus, spaced 90&deg; apart, each across from one of the tubes connecting the Torus to the Hub. The shallow bowls at the bottom of the cones connecting them to the Torus experience centrifugal force of nearly one gravity. This means crew would move regularly between environments with different levels of gravity. Over time, monitoring of the crew's health establishes how much time in how much gravity is needed for good health. </li>
        <li>The solar panels need to be quite extensive for the Station to do its construction and processing work, and to supply the labs with all the power they need. They extend from the end of the hub opposite the hexagon of trusses, together with the
        radiator panels. </li>
        <li>Many elements of the final components built, including internal elements of the Torus and the Teardrops, are made with materials from the Moon</li>
        <li>Water and lunar dust from the Moon turn the greenhouses and animal habitats into complex micro-environments. This enables experiments in creating fertile soil from the lunar dust, cultivation of a wide range of plants, and the adaptation of small animals to the small garden environments thus created.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <h5><a href="machines2.html#PodShip">Pod Ships start shuttling between Earth orbit and Lunar Orbit</a></h5>
    <p>The Pod Ships are operated remotely. They are capable of doing rendezvous and docking maneuvers on their own. Basically they are a nose with all the operating systems, a robotic arm, and a pair of solar panel wings, then a long truss with racks for the pods, and then the fuel tanks and engines on the far end.</p>
    <p>The pods are the space equivalent of shipping containers - standardized and mass-produced tubes with rounded ends covered in insulation and Whipple shielding, a sliding door, internal structures for storage, and connectors if items need power or a comms connection. A Pod Ship can take 8 small pods or 4 long ones. Crew are transported in pods adapted for life support and basic accommodations. Some pods are  water tanks, returning mined water from the Moon to the EESS. Pod Ships are designed for a maximum payload of 80 tons to lunar orbit when operations begin.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>Pod Ship Operations and Early Missions</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>These ships have next gen hydrolox engines capable of many restarts. They get serviced between trips at the EESS.</li>
      <li>Early missions are all to a polar orbit. Once tether construction begins, they all enter a circular orbit about 20&deg; off the Moon's terminator (between the night side and the day side), at an altitude of 5000 km. The skyhook complex goes there so that not only does it have constant sunlight on its solar panels,<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#terminator">[?]</sup> but the three later polar skyhooks spaced 45&deg; apart all will too.</li>
      <li>The 1st and 2nd missions deliver 2 Lunar Nuclear Craft, extra fuel, and initial equipment for surface operations.</li>
      <li>Then there are 20 missions to deliver the equipment and components to build the first polar skyhook. The Pod Ship that delivers the first of these stays in orbit so its solar arrays can power the construction equipment, plus it provides a comms link, orbital maintenance, and a stable construction platform. The other in operation at this point delivers materials and equipment every 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>The first half dozen of these missions deploy several satellites each. First is a set of comms satellites so polar ops always has a radio link with Earth. The next three bring  sets of observation satellites for imaging in high resolution and a suite of wavelengths, plus radar, lidar, and gravity mapping. The last two deploy a lunar GPS system </li>
      <li>On the 3rd skyhook mission, a crew pod is dropped off and connected to the Pod Ship staying in orbit, with a crew of 4 that stay for 4 weeks. They oversee initial deployment and testing of the skyhook construction equipment, and remotely operate equipment at the lunar pole. The 6th one delivers the superstructure of the future Crossroads Station, and the Pod Ship leaves, handing off its duties to that skeletal Station. The role of the Station after this is outlined in its section below.</li>
      <li> A few months after the start of lunar surface operations, ongoing missions commence to deliver fuel, equipment and materials which the LNCs transfer to polar ops. </li>
      <li>By the end of this phase, the Pod Ships have delivered many loads of equipment and supplies, and have rotated many crews. They return to the EESS carrying water, regolith and rock, and initial in situ processed materials for testing, and later, for incorporation into internal elements of the EESS.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <div class="tooltip_templates">
    <span id="terminator">
      Maintaining the orbit with this relationship to the terminator requires it be made to precess one revolution around the poles each year. Our estimate is that this requires a few meters per second of delta V each day, which fits easily into the fuel budget.
    </span>
  </div>
    <h5><a href="machines2.html#nuclearShuttles">Lunar Nuclear Craft (LNCs, pronounced 'links')</a></h5>
    <p>These craft use nuclear thermal engines with a bipropellant design, known as a <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20170004744&hterms=lantr+nuclear+thermal&qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchallany%26Ntt%3Dlantr%2Bnuclear%2Bthermal">LANTR design</a>. They get thrust by superheating hydrogen, and during launch and landing, can greatly augment that thrust by injecting oxygen into the engine nozzle, basically like an afterburner. They are designed for vertical landing and takeoff.
    </p>
    <p>The LNCs are similar in architecture to the Pod Ships, including being self-piloting. The difference is their engines are nuclear, which means they include heavy shielding, and they don't have solar panels, as they draw their electrical power from the nuclear reactor as well. Their racks have space for up to 4 small pods or 2 large ones. Thanks to their bipropellant capability, they are able to launch and land about 20 tons of payload even before there is a tether reducing the delta V required, though it takes a lot more fuel to do so. Once the tether is in place, they are designed to move loads up to 40 tons to and from the tether foot.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary>LNC Operations and Early Missions</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Initially the LNCs help the surface rovers set up operations by providing supplemental power from their onboard reactors, acting as a comms link, and using their robotic arms</li>
        <li>Once water production allows supplementing of their fuel supply, and the growing tether lowers delta V requirements, they shuttle loads of lunar rock to the tether foot. This is taken up to the tether anchor to increase its mass. They do this as often as possible.</li>
        <li>With further increases in water production, they begin delivering tanks of water to the tether foot as well, as often as possible.</li>
        <li>They do a series of sortie missions to the lunar maria and areas of interest, collecting samples for analysis and experimentation, and surveying.</li>
        <li>Before people can be landed on the surface, a system needs to be constructed to keep them safe from the radiation of the LNC engines. A well is excavated in the LNC landing pad, so that before people exit the craft, the engine section is unclamped and lowered into it, eliminating the radiation hazard. This unclamping and lowering system must be built into the craft from the beginning, and should be used as soon as the well is built, though people won't arrive for a couple of years.</li>
      </ul>
  </details>
  <h5><a href="https://www.moonwards.com/machines2.html#TetherTransport">Crossroads Skyhook</a> and Anchor Station Construction</h5>
  <p>Once the superstructure for Crossroads is delivered, it is continuously occupied by crews of 8, who stay for 4 weeks at a time. Further deliveries by the Pod Ships build up its capacity, and the regolith that the LNCs send up establish good shielding. Once there is enough shielding over key areas such as sleeping berths, crews begin to extend their stays. By the end of this phase a crew of 12 is always aboard, and people stay for up to a year at a time.
  </p>
  <p>The crew of Crossroads can operate the robots on the lunar surface, and on the skyhook, without the significant delay during transmissions from Earth which slow and complicate tele-operation. Much more complex and dynamic robotic work can be done in this situation. That is explained in the next column.
  </p>
  <p>By the end of this phase, the lower tether is equipped with a foot platform that can berth a fully loaded LNC, a tip platform that can berth a fully loaded Pod Ship, and climbers that can transfer the full payloads of both. This requires a total of 1000 tons of Zylon woven into a ribbon extending 5000 km downwards and another reaching 4500 km upwards, which can carry the load of the platforms, climbers, maintenance and motion control systems, berthed ships, and cargo, with a safety factor of 2.</p>
  <p>The complete skyhook allows the LNCs to reach the foot platform using one fifth of the delta V needed to reach orbit, and the Pod Ships to break lunar orbit on an Earth trajectory with no fuel use at all - they just let go of the top of the tether.</p>
  <details>
    <summary>Crossroads Systems and Operations</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>The climber cars run on <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/716070main_Mankins_2011_PhI_SPS_Alpha.pdf">power beamed as microwaves</a> from the anchor station and from the foot platform. Onboard flywheel energy storage allows them to go short distances without receiving external power. There are 10 waystations along both tethers, where cars can pass each other, and where microwave receivers and transmitters pass power from either end of the tether up or down. Such receivers and transmitters can be very light, though some need to be large to be effective. The large ones can be mostly on the anchor station, where their mass doesn't matter.<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#nukepower">[?]</sup> </li>
      <li>The waystations also make it easier for maintenance and stabilizer carts to shuttle along the tether checking and repairing its cables, and releasing and catching momentum-exchange weights. The waystations are places where the carts can recharge their flywheels (though they also have microwave receivers for power). At the waystations, the tether is stronger and more protected. When new cables are woven into the tether, it is done between waystations. </li>
      <li>The anchor station runs on solar power. Because the tether orbits near the terminator, the only time its solar arrays aren't in sunlight is during the occasional eclipse by the Earth. The solar arrays are extended over time as a wing extending from one side of the station. </li>
      <li>Maintaining anchor altitude and a circular orbit is mostly achieved through passive momentum transfer, by dropping and retrieving weights. Engines on the anchor supplement this and do the work of precessing the anchor's orbit to keep it always in the same relationship to the sun. VASMIR drives, or Neumann drives, or maybe HiPEP drives - whatever wins the high-ISP race will do nicely.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <div class="tooltip_templates">
    <span id="nukepower">
      An alternative is the climber cars run on nuclear power from a small reactor connected to Stirling engine generators. By putting the reactor in a separate car and running a power cable from there to the climber, the reactor can be kept a kilometer or more from the climber, allowing a shield with a smaller area to be used between the two. A shielded dock thus has to be made above the foot platform, so the climber can pass the reactor and reach its destination. A dock that is about 10 km from the anchor station is also needed, so the cone of shielded space is wide enough to cover the whole station, and anything that might stick out gets a weaker dose. Overall, the microwave beaming approach seems more flexible, more robust, and safer, as long as the beams can be kept well aligned despite oscillations due to actions on the tether. The transmitters would need to be able to rotate a small amount to keep receivers in their focus. Having flywheels to store energy as well thus is also interesting in that they can be used simultaneously to dampen oscillations. Energy harvested when climbers control descent by braking could also be used to spin up the flywheels. Perhaps calculations would show the flywheels would be too heavy to be a significant help, pending that it is just a thought.
