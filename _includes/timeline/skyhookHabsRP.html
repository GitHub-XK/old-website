  <h5><a href="machines2.html#TetherTransport">Vertical Skyhook Construction in Polar Orbit</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li><h6>7500 ton Asteroid for the Anchor</h6> is brought into medium polar orbit, 5000 km above the surface. Surveys of Near Earth Asteroids will be much more complete by then, so it is reasonable to expect a carbonaceous asteroid that is suitable will have been found and collected. Its content of carbon and metal would be its most valuable contribution, as water is being mined from the lunar pole at less expense. But its hydrated minerals are still of value.</li>
   <li><h6>Gear Installed and Tested</h6> Zylon cables, construction equipment, solar panels and ion engines, and a nuclear-powered cable car are brought from Earth to the asteroid. Some small scale tests will already have been done in preparation. Now further testing and experimentation is done to ensure a robust design.</li>
   <li><h6>Tether Extended Downwards</h6> from the asteroid towards the surface. The first increment is only a few kilometers, then a hundred kilometers is added, than a thousand. The platform at the foot, the procedure by which the nuclear shuttle meets it and is grappled, oscillation control on the tether, the cable car, and cable car propulsion are all thoroughly tested at these scales and further refined.</li>
   <li><h6>Full Lower Tether</h6>The tether is extended in increments of 1000 km until it reaches an altitude of 20 km above the surface.</li>
   <li><h6>Cable Car Propulsion</h6>The first cable car is nuclear, but it may receive supplemental power beamed from the asteroid in order to increase its capacity. The best method for powering future cars may be beamed power, or nuclear might be the best solution.</li>
   <li><h6>Skyhook's Momentum Saves 4/5th of Delta V</h6> the nuclear shuttle will only need to use 1/5th of the delta V needed to reach and return from lunar orbit to reach the platform of the tether foot and return. It will need that same 1/5th of the normal delta V to go anywhere on the Moon by grappling the platform and hanging off it until it is over its destination, and to return to base the same way. </li>
   <li><h6>Upper Tether</h6> is extended upwards 9500 km, given a cable car designed to ferry ships from the anchor, and a platform at the tip. At the altitude of the tip, release of a vessel gives it enough speed to reach Earth. This construction proceeds much faster as the process is now understood.</li>
   <li><h6>Platform HiPEP Ion Engines</h6> The engines are moved from the asteroid to the tether tip where their force is most effective in maintaining the skyhook's orbit. Short-term, orbital perturbations are compensated for by moving cars that act as counterweights up or down the two tethers. In case of emergency, if somehow the orbital altitude of the structure has lowered and the foot is at risk of crashing into the ground and being dragged across it, a nuclear thermal rocket engine can fire at the tether tip to quickly raise orbit.</li>
   <li><h6>Conversion of the Asteroid to a Space Station</h6> Early steps in that direction are carried out during skyhook construction, replacing payloads of asteroid material with simple vessels and beams made of fused regolith.</li>
   <li><h6>5 km/s Delta V now saved between Moon and Earth</h6>The full skyhook saves about 2 km/s delta V to get something to the Moon from Earth, and 3 km/s to get something back.</li>
   <li><h6>Cheap Moon Fuel</h6>The mining of ice from the poles now is used to fuel the pod ship on the Earth/Moon run, and the nuclear shuttles, completely. Some water is shipped to the space station in LEO so it can be a fuel depot for other ships.</li>
  </ul>
<h5>A Bigger Asteroid Fetcher</h5>
<p>The asteroid retrieval ship remains connected to the anchor asteroid at first, then it is taken apart and upgraded. It gets bigger engines and larger solar panels, its asteroid bagging equipment is improved. While work on the skyhook proceeds, it is sent out again to get a larger asteroid of 25 kilotons.</p>
<p><b>Cargo runs between LEO and the polar skyhook now occur at every opportunity: every 2 weeks, 26 per year.</b></p>

  <h5><a href="colonies.html#InukshukModels">Completion of First Hab</a></h5>
  <ul>
   <li><h6>Fused Regolith Objects</h6>The simple boards, beams, rods and such that the MIP stations can produce are sufficient for the bulk of this hab, without needing cables or fiber reinforcement. They can also be used to produce simple furnishings (tables, shelves, doors, chairs, beds...) and simple implements (jugs, cups, bowls, boxes, shovels, rakes...) </li>
   <li><h6>Imported Objects</h6> - the roof membrane, life support systems, plumbing and wiring, lights, appliances, and more come from Earth and are installed. 3d printers using metal powder have already been successfully used to create certain parts for the robots, and can reduce what must be shipped from Earth a little, but mostly just by reducing the number of replacement parts sent along.  </li>
   <li><h6>Crew of 30 Arrive on 2 Year Mission</h6>Once the hab has been pressurized and all the systems successfully tested, they arrive. At the end of the initial mission they may be rotated out for other people, but the staff remains 30 people. From the outset, this crew is selected based on the psychological philosophy the Residence Program will also follow: they are all couples married at least 10 years, over 40, with no children under 18. As anticipated, most of the original crew chooses to stay on the Moon permanently.</li>
   <li><h6>Development of industrial and farming processes</h6> is their mission. They are able to accomplish a great deal quickly, because operators on Earth continue to  teleoperate the existing equipment. They operate robots remotely from within the hab or a rover with a pressurized cab, or bring things into the hab to work on them. Doing manual labor outside in a spacesuit is avoided because it is clumsy. They are rapidly able to innovate.</li>
   <li>Once they complete the first greenhouse and fill it with healthy plants, greatly increase production of water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, complete the first solar thermal power plant, add a second, much larger hab using an expanded range of local products, and meet a set of test goals demonstrating that it is safe to expand the population, the Residence Program begins</li>
   <li><h6>Inukshuk Base is Declared a Permanent Settlement</h6>Due to the great significance of the first permanent habitat on another celestial body, the first completed hab is simply called First Hab. The second hab becomes known as Long Hab because it is long and narrow.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Sagan Space Station</h5>
  <p><h6>Perfect Place for a Great Telescope</h6> Easy servicing, power and data trasmission provided by existing station infrastructure, mass of the telescope not an issue, aiming and tracking of the scope very easy (though elaborate measures have to be taken to isolate it from vibrations and oscillations due to other activity on the skyhook). The anchor makes an excellent home for a really awesome telescope. For this reason it is named for Carl Sagan, an astronomer who dreamed of space settlement and is a figurehead of the movement. </p>
  <p>Nothing else is planned for this skyhook - activities will occur at Gagarin Station on the equatorial skyhook once it is built. All that needs to happen at Sagan, is that its mass be replaced with bulk regolith and fused regolith structures so its valuable minerals can be extracted at Inukshuk, and it needs to berth the pod ship every two weeks while payload transfers occur, and mechanisms on it need to keep the skyhook's orbit in good shape.</p>
  <p>Once Gagarin is commissioned, the pod ship will berth there instead. Shuttles will continue to use Sagan's skyhook for travel around the Moon, but will no longer send payload up the tether. Instead, they will take payloads to Lalande, and from there they will be sent up Gagarin's skyhook. Once all the useful minerals in Sagan's asteroid are used up, things will be pretty peaceful there. The telescope can be spread out, given multiple mirrors and fancy shades to protect it from heat and radiation. Once it is no longer needed for transport to and from the surface, the telescope's needs dictate development on that skyhook.</p>

  <h5>The Residence Program Begins</h5>
  <p>This is actually the final step of this phase, happening after everything in the other columns is done. However, preparation has been happening for years.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Long Hab houses the first 200 astronauts of the program. Each is a married couple selected by their countries to go to the Moon permanently - to live out the rest of their lives there. For this privilege, these nations pay $150 million per astronaut. All astronauts must meet stiff criteria agreed upon by all the nations:
   <ul>
    <li><h6>Stable Married Couples</h6>They must be a married couple with no children under the age of 18, married at least 10 years, and at least 40 years of age. </li>
    <li><h6>Scientists and Engineers</h6> who can play an active role in studying and developing the Moon. Minimum qualification is both have at least a bachelor's degree in the sciences or engineering, one has a more advanced degree or outstanding professional career in a relevant area.</li>
    <li><h6>Good for Shows</h6>They must participate regularly in programming broadcast back to Earth, both by appearing on camera, and by coming up with content for such programming. There are many options - arts, sports, educational content, conversational content, games. Ability in an art or a sport will be part of the criteria by which they are selected.</li>
    <li><h6>Science and Safety</h6>They must donate their bodies to science upon death.</li>
    <li>As it is so important, might as well just say that they all must have had a vasectomy or a tubal ligation</li>
    <li>They must be in excellent health</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
   <li><h6>Broad International Population</h6>Nations may send a number of representatives, but at the same time, there is a deliberate effort to send a group that truly represents all the races, religions, language groups, regions, and ways of life of humanity.</li>
   <li>The crew of First Hab is expanded to 50 when the RP starts. They are the senior staff, who come from the ISA nations. As the Residence Program is the main initial revenue stream, it is made of people from other nations. There is overlap due to, for instance, the many nations of the European Union wishing to have nationals in the settlement, as only a few would have nationals in First Hab. Other space-faring nations may also forego recuperation of their investment in order to have a few more citizens on the Moon. Still, the bulk of the people in RP Round 1 come from places other than the founder nations.</li>
   <li><h6>Affordable Entry</h6>Payment for each spot may be made over 5 years. Today, there are 63 countries in the world with annual national budgets over US$30 billion. Examples of countries at that US$30 billion level include Slovakia, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Luxembourg. By the time the program began there would be a number of others.</li>
   <li>Most of the astronauts would probably be in their mid-40s. They would probably be able to actively participate in colony life for at least 30 years. So, those countries in the list in the point above, for 1% of one year's national budget, would get 2 national superstars on the Moon, that can do way more to inspire national pride and collective interest in science and progress than anything they could do at home, for 30 or 40 years.</li>
  </ul>
   <p><b>There will be 7 rounds to this program. The second one goes partly to Inukshuk, and partly to Lalande. The table shows the main aspects of each round.</b></p>
