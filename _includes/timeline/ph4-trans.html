      <summary><h5>Fleet Expansion - Planetary Fleets, Toss Ships, Busy Skies</h5></summary>
      <p>Gagarin and CP are now working at full tilt, producing on a larger scale, in larger numbers, and a wider variety of spacecraft than is imaginable today. With access to all the raw materials and power one could want, and a highly robotized workforce, manufacture of spacecraft and space infrastructure explodes. More of all the ships already described are made, as many as is called for, ramping up with the quickly increasing capabilities of the colonies and all the projects they are able to dream up.</p>
      <p>The Asteroid Retrieval Fleet targets ever larger and choicer asteroids. It concentrates on carbonaceous asteroids with easily accessible water, which equipment on the Fetchers splits into hydrogen and oxygen to fuel the engines. A few metal asteroids are brought in. Several are used to anchor the Anshar skyhook and the later skyhook constellation. By 5 years into this phase only asteroids over 100 kilotons are being returned, at a rate of dozens per year.  By 10 years in, they are several megatons each, coming in at the same rate.</p>
      <p>The Pod ships are mostly phased out in favor of Toss ships (discussed below), while the role of LNCs diversifies, and several types are built for different roles. Small ones with small engines serve the regular runs to the skyhooks, once the electric runways take over most of the delta v burden. Ones with big engines do point to point transport whenever more power is needed, such as when going to a point with no receiving runway, or doing heavy lift. At the end of this phase, a few are <a href="https://www.moonwards.com/2017/08/25/The-Mothership.html">mother ships</a> - they are designed to safely transport pregnant women.</p>
      <details id="planetaryFleets">
      <summary>Planetary Fleets</summary>
      <p>At the start of this phase, carbon nanotube cable starts being manufactured in bulk, and that means skyhooks get scattered through the solar system, creating the Skyhook Interplanetary Transport Hubs. Both things are discussed below. The traffic level that makes possible, especially from Mercury to the Asteroid Belt, means that each of the inner planets is given its own fleet. Mars and Venus each get several toss ships specialized for the separate routes they ply, and each has two Schooners assigned to it - those are ships like the Roddenberry, fast and powerful. The sailing ships of Mercury are discussed below. </p>
      <p>Callisto gets a set of LNC-type vessels for the Jovian system, a Schooner, and a couple of Toss ships as well. The Saturn system gets 2 LNCs, based on Rhea. 2 Galleons (Rumi-class ships) serve those two systems, spending time around Jupiter or around Saturn as needed. A bunch of Galleons shuttle between the outer asteroid belt and the inner planets carrying water ice or metal. Psyche and Ceres get Toss ships of their own.</p>
      <p>Earth and the Moon are brimming with ships going here and there. They skip between the various space stations and skyhooks - transport vessels, private vessels, constructions ships, tugs and service vessels. Toss ships dominate. A fleet of Schooners accumulates.</p>
    </details>
    <details id="tossShips">
      <summary>Toss Ships</summary>
      <p>Once skyhooks come into their own, ships start being made that just go from one to the other, around different worlds. They get almost all the speed they need at launch thanks to how much faster the tip of a skyhook is moving than orbital speed, and roughly the right trajectory by choosing the right moment to release from the tether. For less speed on release, they can let go from a spot lower on the upper tether. On arrival, much of the delta V needed to brake and enter orbit is saved by docking to the upper tether of that skyhook, which is already moving fast enough to be close to the speed of the ship when it comes in, meaning only a small burn is needed. If the skyhook tip is moving faster than the ship, it can aim for a point lower down that has the same velocity it has. Then it only has to be lined up to come in at the right angle for smooth docking.
      </p>
      <p>
      Skyhooks all have their own Hopper fleet, some of which are now specialized for handling Toss ships. On launch, they hang on to the Toss ship and refine its trajectory with their large nuclear thermal engines, also giving it some more delta V if needed. On arrival, they rendezvous with incoming Toss ships and use their engines to do any deceleration and the maneuvers for docking. Normally they take the Toss ship in directly without it even orbiting first.</p>
      <p>In normal operations the Toss ships don't even fire their engines. The Hoppers do everything. This way, all the Toss ships need is a complement of solid booster engines they can fire in an emergency to ensure they enter any kind of orbit around their destination world. Such engines are very simple and robust, they can sit unused for years and still work reliably in an emergency.
      </p>
      <p>Toss ships thus are basically a sturdy frame that can take either container pods or haul bulk cargo in a single hold, a few solid rocket motors, and a bit of kit for avionics and comms and such. They are cheap and fast to build but they last a long time with little maintenance. Their cargo is often more valuable than the ship itself. Their purpose is to move lots and lots of mass quickly, and their design allows their numbers to grow rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>Toss ships are big, and scale up more as the phase progresses. Traffic of Toss ships also grows quickly. When the Venus, Mars, Mercury, and Earth skyhooks open, fully loaded Toss ships mass up to 12 kilotons. By the time it ends, fully loaded small ones mass 30 kt, the big ones 100 kt. The 100 kt ships are known as Chukwa<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#chukwa">[?]</sup> class. The Skyhooks manage to carry that mass by ferrying arriving ships down the upper tether to the anchor station after they dock, and berthing them there. Once berthed the tether can launch or dock another Chukwa. In unusual cases, multiple Hoppers can be used to maneuver in a Chukwa for docking right at an anchor station, allowing them to rendezvous with skyhooks whose tethers are too weak to bear their mass.
      </p>
      <p>Passenger Toss ships are globes with shielding made of 1.5 m of liquid ammonia between an inner and outer hull made of aluminum, carbon fiber, and laminated quartz. Only the ones on the Earth - Moon run don't have that, just a solar storm shelter padded with the passengers' own luggage and a modicum of cargo. Cargo pods can also be designed for people, so they can go on cargo vessels. After the space and taken up by the shielding, a large cargo pod still has interior dimensions of 5 m diameter by 37 m long.</p>
      <p>Things that need to get where they are going quickly are placed on the smallest Toss ships, which can get more kick from the Hoppers, and can release from the tip of any launch skyhook. If they need to get there even faster, they go aboard Galleons, or even Schooners, for real emergencies. The giant Chukwas often skip from skyhook to skyhook to reach their destination, which makes their journeys much longer. </p>

      <summary>Busy Skies</summary>
      <p>So this phase sees the heavens filling with ships on all sorts of missions here and there. Too many missions to mention, and normal routine business that quickly is not worth regarding as a mission at all. Robots and AI are so reliable that ships doing cargo runs, mining, servicing, and even construction don't have any people aboard. Even passenger ships have a minimal crew, who don't do much besides maintaining a pleasant atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The Schooners travel far and wide through the solar system, visiting everywhere, leaving a trail of observation satellites and rovers in their wake. They even make it to a few Kuiper belt objects. Several probes are sent even further than that, out to the Oort cloud, and to dark Planet 9. Probes launched from Mercury plunge into the sun. People take sky cruises around the Earth and Moon. There are numerous space-based construction projects serviced by various spacecraft. There is so much traffic, that there is official traffic control for the Earth Moon system. </p>

    <details id="cntCable">
      <summary><h5>Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Cable</h5></summary>
      <p>Aside from the explosion in activity caused by advanced robotics, CNT cable is the thing that makes this all possible. It also has a profound impact on architecture. In fact, bulk, high quality CNTs have deep implications in almost every technology sector, as does graphene, which should also be producible in bulk if CNTs are. </p>
      <p>The most promising technique for bulk production of extremely long CNTs is widely considered to be chemical vapor deposition. Processes of that kind are likely to benefit from a microgravity environment, which greatly changes fluid dynamics, and a hard vacuum, which makes it easier to produce chemicals of extremely high purity. Here we posit that once humanity manages to fabricate this material in bulk, it can be counted on to have a tensile strength of 30 GPa. Carbon nanotubes have a bulk density of 1.3 to 1.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. (A matrix of another material might be needed to bind them together, but the density of that shouldn't be any higher). This is an estimate of the material properties of the first carbon nanotube cables.<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#CNT">[?]</sup> To model a skyhook system, it was necessary to choose numbers for these values. It should be noted that as manufacturing techniques advance, it is reasonable to suppose that tensile strengths as high as 100 GPa will be attained. Currently exotic methods, such as cross-linking the nanotubes to produce threads made solely of CNTs, may one day become feasible on an industrial scale.</p>
      <div class="tooltip_templates">
        <span id="CNT">
        The tensile strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes ranges from 11 to 150 GPa in experimental results. Defects in the atomic lattice are what lowers this strength.

      <summary><h5>The Skyhook Interplanetary Transport Hubs (SITH)</h5></summary>
      <p>Skyhooks are erected all over during this phase. Trips throughout the solar system almost always involve at least one, usually two, and often three. Those for Earth, and the rejigging of the ones for the Moon, are discussed in later subsections. Of the ones in the following list, those at Mars and Venus are constructed first, then Mercury, and finally in order going further outwards from the sun. What takes the longest is transport time of the materials. The CNT cables are so massive it takes several trips to get the whole things to their destinations. This is less of a factor with the inner planets as trip times are shorter and launch windows more frequent.</p>
      <details id="surfaceLaunchPairs">
        <summary>Surface and Launch Skyhook Pairs</summary>
      <p> Skyhooks are often specialized for either surface operations, or launch operations. The worlds of the inner solar system all have at least one of each. Surface skyhooks have achor masses that orbit higher, so the speed of their foot platforms is slower relative to the surface. That lowers the energy needed to reach the foot platform, or land from there. Launch skyhooks have anchors that orbit lower to take greater advantage of the gravity well of their primary. </p>
      <p>Each launch skyhook is paired to a surface skyhook with a matching orbit, offset by 20&deg; or so. They are in orbital resonance, usually with a ratio of 7:1. For instance, the Venus surface skyhook orbits once for each 7 orbits of the launch skyhook. So, at any given altitude, the launch skyhook is moving 7 times the speed of the surface skyhook. </p>
      <p>The upper tether of a launch skyhook masses 10% to 20% less than the upper tether of a skyhook like the original Gagarin skyhook, that combines both surface and launch duties. For interplanetary skyhooks, upper tethers are by far the heaviest, as they bear heavy payloads and have high accelerations at their tips. The cable mass savings of building paired skyhooks remains significant even though there are 4 tethers instead of 2, and the extra tethers add very useful capacity.</p>
      <p>The savings in some cases are multiplied by handling Chukwas entirely on the surface skyhook. The upper tethers of these skyhooks have much less acceleration, with just enough range to get a Chukwa to the next hop on their trip. If the 100 kt behemoths stick to that skyhook, and the launch skyhook handles ships massing no more than 30 kt, that cable can mass 30% of what it otherwise would. That's the cable that makes up the lion's share of the mass of all the cables in a skyhook pair.</p>
      <p>But most of those savings get reinvested as extra carrying capacity on the foot platform of the launch skyhooks. As they are so short, the cable mass needed to carry each ton of payload is much less than a ton. And there is an imperative to position the center of gravity of the whole skyhook between the two tethers. If it isn't there, and instead is far out along the upper tether because that thing is so heavy, the whole orbit drops down and that is either really wasteful or a disaster that causes the whole thing to crash. However, that same great mass of the upper tether means it takes an awful lot of mass at the anchor shaft to move the center of gravity down within it. </p>
      <p>The efficient thing to do is to put a really heavy foot station on the bottom of the launch skyhook. Ton for ton, that moves the center of gravity many times more than putting more mass in the anchor. And since that is the best move anyhow, now we are free to have two stations on these skyhooks instead of one. Those foot stations are all within 100 km of the surface, a couple are only 20 km above it. There is plenty of mass in the budget to put in excellent water shielding, and still have the mass budget left over for a station that houses thousands of people, plus all the bells and whistles for it to be an observation platform, beam power to the surface, and whatever else.</p>

    </details>
    <details id="optmizTraffic">
      <summary>Optimizing Inner Solar System Traffic</summary>
      <p> The Chukwas are the ones that often use 3 or even 4 skyhooks to get to where they are going. They are too heavy for many launch skyhooks to throw them directly to their destination, in which case they have to hop to an intermediate world. It might take a while for a world to be in range for a decent trajectory, but launch windows can really be stretched by vessels releasing from somewhat higher on the tether than is needed for that destination, so the ship is going faster after release. Also, to go from Venus to Earth or vice versa, it's often faster to launch to Mercury, and then go from Mercury to either planet. Launch windows to either place occur on Mercury usually 3 times a year, whereas launch windows between Earth and Venus happen about every year and a half. There is a greater plane-change to deal with in the case of Mercury, as its orbit is inclined 7&deg; to the ecliptic, but inclining the orbit of the Mercury skyhooks the right way can largely handle that.</p>
      <p> Once there is enough traffic that there is more than one ship on a skyhook at a time, incoming ships need to be ferried down to the anchor station and berthed there until it is time for them to leave. That's generally the best way to do things anyhow, though it's easiest if a ship is unloaded before being ferried, so the cable car doesn't have to haul so much at once. It makes loading and maintenance much easier, and passengers can go back and forth from their ship to the anchor station at will.</p>
      <p>The high-traffic skyhooks of the Moon and Earth have greater demands on them to manage momentum to keep the orbits of the skyhooks stable. Sometimes giant boulders are thrown from the Moon to Earth or vice versa for no other reason than to transfer momentum. Because the ships that come in to these skyhooks are so big and there are so many, the trick of release and retrieve stops being sufficient to quickly adjust momentum when traffic is heavy. Release and retrieve is when momentum is shed by releasing a massive boulder from a point on an upper tether, or added by releasing it from a point on a lower tether. Those boulders are retrieved when their orbits bring them back to the skyhook. Though there are dozens of such boulders on each skyhook and they can mass up to a kiloton, more momentum can be added or subtracted by catching a boulder thrown from another world, or throwing one to another world. The Earth and Moon play catch this way to trade momentum when needed, and those boulders sometimes mass 30 kt.</p>
    </details>
    <details id="miningPhobos">
      <summary>Adding Anchor Mass: the Mining of Phobos</summary>
        <p>At first, the anchor masses of these skyhooks aren't very big. Once they are set up, their fleet of Hoppers, LNCs, and a couple of Fetchers, get to work adding mass to the anchor whenever possible. Maintaining their orbits takes a lot more fuel and trickery with passive masses until the anchors are many times heavier than the cables, and the heaviest ships that come and go. The Fetchers go after anything that comes in range on a convenient trajectory, the LNCs use all their spare time to ferry mass made of whatever to the foot platform, to be taken up and added to the anchor. Accumulating mass this way is far too slow, though. It would take a long time to really stabilize the skyhooks using only what the local fleets can bring in. The issue is that Venus has no LNCs because the surface is far too hostile to send LNCs down there, Mercury doesn't have many asteroids passing by that are easily caught, and at Earth, even with the huge drop in the price of launching to orbit caused by Anshar, shipping rocks to orbit makes no sense.
        </p>
        <p>So, bits of the moon Phobos are spat to Venus, Mercury, and Earth to pump that mass up way faster. Phobos is, in fact, the anchor of the surface skyhook of Mars. It masses 10 million megatons, so it can spare a few thousand megatons for miscellaneous ballast and shielding material in projects elsewhere over the coming decades. Its surface is conveniently composed of dust and small rocks. The biggest issues with mining it for these purposes is keeping the dust contained so it doesn't form a haze around the moonlet that takes forever to settle. Once it's bagged, the bags gets thrown off the end of the upper tether of Phobos on the fast track for Earth, or Venus. We are talking bags of dust and rubble massing 100 kt. The Hoppers refine their trajectories for their destinations before returning to Phobos, and Hoppers on the other end do the same thing, shepherding the bags in to the receiving skyhooks. As the Phobos tether can throw to Earth and Venus good and hard, launch windows are long and trip times are short. Hundreds of these bags can be tossed each time either destination planet is in range. Mercury can get deliveries by the Earth launcher skyhook  re-throwing bags its way.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this supply, the anchor masses of all the skyhooks of the inner solar system are piled up to 20 megatons by the end of this phase, and a few exceed 50 megatons.
        </p>
    </details>

      <details id="sithSkyhooks">
        <summary>Skyhooks of the SITH</summary>
        <p>All of these skyhooks are made of CNT cable. The figures shown are for the configuration attained by the end of this Phase. All of them will be operating long before that, but with less capacity. As more cable is woven into the tethers, capacity increases. </p>
        <details id="tableDetails">
          <summary>Table Details</summary>
          <p>In the rows that show tether mass, this is the mass of just the CNT cable. Those numbers show the mass first in metric kilotons, and then in the brackets, as what multiple it is of the payload mass. Really the payload mass should be multiplied by 1.05 to account for the mass of the climber, the foot platform, and all the infrastructure on the tether for maintenance and power transmission. It also doesn't count the mass of the shaft that joins the two tethers together, around which the anchor mass is built up. That probably adds another 1% or so to the total cable mass. These things aren't done for the sake of simplicity. The grand total of both skyhooks also includes the mass of the foot station on the launch skyhook. As that mass directly bears on the mass of the cables and the strain on them, it is included there. Anchor mass uninvolved with bearing the weight on the cables has little relevance to the overall structure, other than it affects the center of gravity of the whole thing. It goes up and down over time, mostly up, and adds stability in general as it grows. </p>
          <p>Tether figures use a safety factor of 2. That factor accounts for what a tether needs to operate safely even despite wear and tear, manufacturing defects, and damage due to any micrometeoroid strikes. Early skyhooks made of Zylon need a safety factor of 3, but because CNTs are much stiffer, can handle a wider range of temperatures, and don't degrade in sunlight, SF of 2 is enough. It means these cables never bear more than 50% of the maximum load they could theoretically sustain according to their ultimate tensile strength.</p>
          <p> All skyhooks are made of an open weave of cables known as a <a href="http://www.tethers.com/Hoytether.html"> 'Hoytether'</a> weave, after Robert Hoyt of Tethers Unlimited. That design makes it easy for maintenance carts to weave in new cables when they detect a weakness on a cable. This may mean that a safety factor somewhat less than 2 would be fine. Because tethers must taper so the top of the tether can sustain the mass of all the cable below it, a change in safety factor affects the total mass of a tether in an exponential relationship. Being able to safely reduce the safety factor can drastically reduce the mass of cable that must be fabricated and delivered to build a skyhook. Thus bear in mind that as in all things here, this number is estimated somewhat on the conservative side. </p>

        <span id="polar-equator">
          The Mercury colony will be at the north pole, so the surface skyhook has a polar orbit. The launch skyhook needs to have an orbit inclined 7&deg; from the equator or it is rarely aligned for launches to other planets. So, ships coming and going are all going to have to deal with an 83&deg; plane changes when moving between skyhooks. Being able to do the plane change between two upper tethers should reduce the fuel needed compared to plane changes without that assistance.

          Because the surface skyhook has a polar orbit, it can't be used to handle launch of Chukwas. The launch skyhook has to do it all. It has to be able to bear 100 kt at its tip.

        <span id="skyhookMass">
          A skyhook that combined the tasks of launch and surface ops, and had similar capacity to the skyhook pair shown here, would need to mass about 1008 kt, making it 145 kt heavier than the two skyhooks. Even then, its lower tether would only be able to support 3 kt, while the lower tether of the launch skyhook can bear 10 kt, albeit its foot is moving much faster and likely there are few cases where it makes sense to use that tether. Not only does a skyhook pair take less material, a spacecraft going up from the anchor station to launch from the launch skyhook only needs to travel half as far. There are twice as many berths, and 8 times as many launch opportunities. It might be a bit tricky to hop from the surface skyhook to the launch skyhook and vice versa, and it takes a little fuel. Overall though, a big plus to have skyhook pairs instead of one that does it all.

        <span id="footSpeed">
          The Earth spins at a velocity of about 450 m/s at the equator, so a launcher would only have to gain speed of 2.35 km/s to reach the foot platform.

          Actually, the average distance of this foot is 192 km, and at apoapsis it is 334 km. Which is a pain, but worth it. This is because its anchor is Phobos. See note below.

        <span id="phobosAnchor">
          The anchor in this case is actually the moon Phobos, which orbits at an average distance of 5980 km from the equator of Mars. But its orbit is rather eccentric, so sometimes it is as close as 5838 km. This is why the foot of these skyhooks can only come down to 50 km, even though since Mars has such a thin atmosphere, and Phobos is such a giant reservoir of momentum there is no need to think about performing orbital corrections to compensate for drag. In fact, the orbit of the launch skyhook will be matched in eccentricity, to make it easier to keep them far apart with little orbital maintenance. However, as the orbit of Phobos is inclined 26&deg; to the ecliptic, a plane change of 26&deg; will be needed to hop to the launch skyhook, as it is best for it to be aligned to the ecliptic to minimize the energy spacecraft launched from it need for plane changes.

          Titan's atmosphere is so dense (1.45 times Earth's at its surface), and its gravity so low (0.14 g, similar to the Moon), that it extends to a great height. Even at this altitude, the foot platform will experience measurable drag that will occasionally need to be corrected for. Vehicles from the surface headed for the foot platform will be able to use lift to get most of the way and require little fuel to cover the remaining distance.

      <div class="tooltip_templates">
        <span id="footStation">
          To place the center of gravity of the launch skyhooks where it needs to be - at the anchor station - the most mass efficient method is to add mass at the foot. If this isn't done, the much greater mass of the upper tether puts the center of gravity inside that tether. A very heavy anchor station goes a long way to fixing this issue, but it isn't enough, and at any rate a solution is needed while that anchor mass is being accumulated. Making a cable capable of sustaining the heavy mass of a large foot station is cheap, it takes only a fraction of a ton for each ton of payload. And then a great facility can be created at the foot, that takes advantage of the proximity to the surface for a great view and reduced radiation shielding needs.<br><br>
          The figures in this row show a rough estimate of how massive the foot station would need to be to place the center of gravity between the upper and lower tethers. The analysis needed to properly estimate this is far beyond my math abilities and will need to wait for a time when someone else can give the question the attention it needs. A precise solution for this is impossible due to the nature of the calculation. Experimentation with an actual system will be necessary to derive a functional formula that gives a really good approximate solution (but not an exact one).

          This isn't enough to get to any other world. It's about 2/3 what's needed to get to Venus, but would rarely be used for that, as this skyhook is in a polar orbit. Venus would rarely be properly aligned with it for a good trajectory to result from a launch from this skyhook. (Mercury's orbit is quite eccentric for a planet, and when it is at aphelion it would be able to launch to much closer to the orbit of Venus, but Venus is unlikely to be there when that ship arrives.) This upper tether exists to assist with transfers between skyhooks, and to give the sailing ships an initial boost.

      <summary>Auxiliary Space Elevators</summary>
      <p>Ceres already has a space elevator, and during this phase it is expanded so it can throw fast to Mars or Jupiter. Most of the Chukwas that come and go hop first to one of those planets and then hop again once or twice to get to their destination. Ceres is less important now for water, and more for its valuable salts - ammonium chloride, sodium carbonate and others. It also seems to have graphite, which would be very valuable indeed. During periods when there are better trajectories from Ceres to the inner planets than from Callisto, Toss ships from Ceres partly carry water, otherwise Callisto is the major shipping point for water.
      </p>
      <p>Psyche is given a small space elevator too. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_Psyche">Psyche</a> (more properly known as 16 Psyche) is an asteroid made of metal 200 km across. Solid mixed metal, mostly iron. Since it is purely metal, it is a convenient place to set up a small plant to refine out the other metals dissolved in the iron. There is so much iron in small asteroids collected by the Fetchers around the inner solar system, it has almost no value. The semi-conductors and platinum group metals dissolved in it though, those have value. Even the copper in it does.</p>
      <p>Its elevator can bear the mass of a fully loaded Schooner - 3 kilotons. It is able to throw ships to Mars or Jupiter with a little speed to spare. It has a mini-Toss ship of its own rated for its maximum payload. Mostly it loads it with only a few hundred tons or so of metals at a time, but by the end of this phase it is able to load it to the brim, and another new one just like it. With each run the Toss ships return with more mining equipment.</p>

    <details id="anshar">
      <summary><h5>Anshar Skyhook</h5></summary>
      <p>Anshar is the surface skyhook for Earth. It is the first skyhook built out of CNT cable. That cable was spun in Gibraltar's manufacturing sphere using carbon extracted from carbonaceous asteroids. Soon after the skyhook opens, another CNT facility is constructed on its anchor mass. That facility then provides the cable for expanding Anshar, and for the rest of the skyhook constellation around Earth that springs up over the coming years.</p>
      <p>The initial anchor mass is a metal asteroid massing 300 kt, and then carbonaceous asteroids are tacked onto that. Within 2 years the anchor masses over 2 megatons. By the end of this phase, both it and it's sister skyhook have anchors massing over 20 megatons. </p>
      <p>An impressive complement of high-specific-impulse VASIMR and Neumann drives are attached to its tip platform and its anchor. In addition to solar panels, there are nuclear reactors providing electricity for the drives. Those reactors can also power nuclear thermal LANTR engines in an emergency for quick orbital corrections or avoidance maneuvers. In fact even the high-I<sub>sp</sub> drives aren't used much, and rarely at full power. Most orbital correction is done with the release and retrieve and by playing catch with the Moon, as described above under Optimizing Inner Solar System Traffic. The drives have to be there in case of emergency. Sometimes they are useful for helping a troubled ship come in to dock, by putting the dock in front of it. </p>
      <p>As the Van Allen belts have been drained, they are no issue for Anshar. It and its sister are tilted 25&deg; to the equator to put them on the plane of the ecliptic. </p>
      <details id="volTraf">
        <summary><h5>High Volume Traffic on Anshar</h5></summary>
        <p>The foot of Anshar Station moves above the surface of Earth at only 2.4 km/s. That is less than a third of the speed needed to attain orbit. The first stages of rockets get up to speeds around 1.5 to 1.8 km/s during launch. Most of the ships arriving at its foot platform are two stage rockets designed for complete reuse thousands of times. A few use other technologies and are also completely reusable. The market for rockets that fly directly to space disappears almost completely.
        </p>
        <p>Scramjets would be another possibility for reaching the foot platform, but they are much more demanding technology. Standard rockets are likely to remain the cheapest and most reliable option. Air launch might become more attractive. The impact on launcher design of the low speed and low altitude of the platform would be great.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever the cheapest launcher design for high volume traffic is, the cost of launching a kilogram to Anshar would be a tiny fraction of that cost today. Building Anshar of course was expensive, but maintenance and repair of it is cheap. This is true of all the skyhooks. The price offered to get from the surface of Earth to Anshar Station quickly drops to US$30 per kg. The price from there to a lunar colony is another US$30 per kg.
        </p>
        <p>Cargo coming in from Anshar costs considerably less. Slag left over from other processes happening on the anchor is used to make simple disposable heat shields, and cargo pods fitted with such a shield are simply dropped from the foot platform to splash down in an ocean. The pod has a beacon so it can be recovered, and parachutes to brake its descent during the last kilometer or two. The pods don't weigh very much, once the heat shield is popped off and allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean. A standard cargo flight returns hundreds of them to Anshar Station. A standard pod for 3 metric tons of cargo weighs only 50 kg when empty, and without its heat shield. Cost per kg for that incoming trip is only US$2.
        </p>
        <p>A hollow sphere of metal can be dropped for even less. Stick a disposable heat shield on the bottom and give it a cheap beacon, and forget about the pod and the parachutes. Mining asteroids for any metal with a price higher than a few dollars a kilogram then becomes competitive.

To seat the center of gravity of the skyhook at the correct point, a foot station is built on it that masses 400 kilotons.</p>
        <p>Then 10 mini-skyhooks are built to complete an observation and telecoms infrastructure for Earth. 4 fill in the rest of the plane Anshar is in, 72&deg; apart on it. The other 5 are in a plane that complements that, with an ascending node exactly on the other side of the planet. They have orbital periods that match Anshar, circling the Earth every 4 hours and 15 minutes. They can only bear spacecraft massing 200 tons, and their upper tethers are only 1000 km long.  </p>
        <p>These skyhooks take over a large fraction of Earth's internet and telecoms service. The skyhooks are bases for servicing and launching of satellites, taking over those duties from the free-flying space stations, as access to them is cheaper and easier. Small Hoppers stationed on them do orbital debris cleanup duty. They are observation platforms with a broad suite of instruments - telescopes across all wavelengths, radar, lidar, monitoring of the magnetosphere and radiation around Earth, gravimetry.</p>
        <p>Together, this set of skyhooks eliminates the necessity for most other satellites in Earth orbit. That allows the vast majority of them to be cleared away so the skyhooks need not worry about colliding with them. Deals are made with operators of satellites being cleared to move their operations onto the skyhooks. Debris in orbit has been mostly handled by the time these events occur and satellites have been slotted into orbits posing no risk to the planned skyhooks for the previous 15 years or so.</p>
        <p>The space stations are moved to orbits just in front of and behind Anshar, where shuttles can very easily hop between them and the skyhook.

      <summary><h5>Electric Runways, and Rejigging the Lunar Skyhooks</h5></summary>
      <p>As shipping volumes increase, and construction at scale becomes widespread, new shuttles are scaled down from the size of recent generations. They are for a fixed system that launches them at a high cadence. They can still haul up to 60 tons, but their engines are smaller, and no longer nuclear. They have enough thrust to overcome lunar gravity, with a thrust-to-weight ratio of around 1.5 when fully loaded. When they launch to Gagarin, they lift off from a runway that accelerates them up to the needed speed and throws them off the end in an arc that peaks just above the altitude of Gagarin's foot platform. Their engines fire only to do the maneuvering for matching vector and speed with the platform. During normal operation, the launch is so precise their engines barely fire at all as they come in and dock. On return, their engines brake their descent, and the runway brakes their horizontal motion.
      </p>
      <p>
      This runway is 15 km long and sloped 60&deg; at the end. The speed at lift-off is about 300 m/s. There is another runway running north-south for traffic with polar skyhooks, with the same length and upward slope at the end. There is also an east-west runway designed for launch to Magnificent Desolation. The horizontal speed needed to reach its foot station is 860 m/s, so it is longer, with less of an upwards slope - 27 km and 17&deg;.
      </p>
      <p>The landing gear on the shuttles is powered through electrical contact made with a rail down the middle of each runway. That power is what accelerates them up to speed, through electrical motors that turn their wheels.  After the shuttles have loaded and unloaded at the foot platform, they wait until the skyhook's next pass over Lalande, and then drop off. They return to the same runway, braking their descent with their own engines and touching down at the other end. On landing, electrical contact is made with that same rail, and as their wheels are slowed with magnetic braking, the generated energy is passed back into the system.
      </p>
      <p> It becomes typical to launch a bunch of these shuttles in quick succession while Gagarin is in range, up to 50. They can be launched at a cadence of up to one every 10 seconds. Each one docks in one of the docking spaces in the vertical stack that now extends up the foot of the skyhook. They are called Geese for the organized way they usually fly all in a row.
      </p>
      <p>Landing gear modules for the big LNCs are made so they can use these runways too, when delivering objects too big or heavy for the Geese, to Gagarin, polar skyhooks, or Inukshuk. The electric current infrastructure is sized to accelerate a fully loaded LNC up to the speed needed to rendezvous with Maggie's foot station. In fact, it is sized to launch a mother ship to Maggie. LNCs are designed for point to point service anywhere on the Moon, if need be. Though they get to places whenever possible by hitching rides on skyhooks, sometimes that is too slow. On such missions, their landing gear can be removed to maximize their payload capacity. In that case, they lift off and land vertically, as they did in the past.
      </p>
      <p>Gagarin is moved to a higher orbit, at 7000 km, and all the polar skyhooks are raised to the same altitude to maintain their staggered orbital rhythm. Magnificent Desolation is converted to the launcher skyhook. For this purpose its orbit is lowered to 1000 km, so it passes by Lalande 7 times for each time Gagarin passes by.
      </p>
      <p>Over time, all the lunar skyhooks are converted from Zylon to CNT. The maintenance carts work on that as they are able. Maggie has to be changed so much that is all done during it's conversion to the launch skyhook.

      <summary><h5>Great Sailing Ships</h5></summary>
      The sunlight at Mercury is ten times as intense as at Earth, so a sail that catches that light and uses it to push a ship can gain or shed speed ten times faster. Building on experience gained when probes and small ships were sent to Mercury to test solar sails, truly giant sails are made and connected to a sort of tug ship. These tug ships attach to the Toss ships coming and going, and stay connected until they have imparted the speed they need to get to their destination in good time. Then they detach and tack back to Mercury. It is a delicate business, moving around those sails so they pull on vessels as desired, and never get tangled in anything.</p>
      <p>The sail tugs almost never go beyond the orbit of Venus. They aren't needed that far out. </p>

    <details id="laserProp">
      <summary><h5>Laser Propulsion</h5></summary>
      <p>A laser system is built at Inukshuk that can be used with a special version of the solar sails (that can handle extremely intense light) to push small probes to relativistic speeds (speeds fast enough to be regarded as a fraction of the speed of light). A series of trials is done with it. Work is done on how to use the extensive infrastructure now spread across the solar system to deploy tools to keep lasers tightly focused on the sails longer. Tests using lenses orbiting several AU from Earth are done, to refocus the beam once the probe passes by. After a while, a second, and then a third laser is built and placed in orbits further from the sun. Schooners reposition the lenses and lasers between trials to align them such that they can focus or fire on a probe once it passes their position.
      </p>
      <p>This is done in preparation for interstellar missions. A capacity to accelerate probes massing up to a kilogram to as much as 30% of the speed of light is created. Though the probes must be small, many can be sent. At the end of this stage, many such probes are launched to our closest neighboring stars.</p>
