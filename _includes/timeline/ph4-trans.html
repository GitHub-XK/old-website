      <summary><h5>Fleet Expansion - Planetary Fleets, Toss Ships, Busy Skies</h5></summary>
      <p>Gagarin and CP are now working at full tilt, producing on a larger scale, in larger numbers, and a wider variety of spacecraft than is imaginable today. With access to all the raw materials and power one could want, and a highly robotized work force, manufacture of spacecraft and space infrastructure explodes. More of all the ships already described are made, as many as is called for, ramping up with the quickly increasing capabilities of the colonies and all the projects they are able to dream up.</p>
      <p>The Asteroid Retrieval Fleet targets ever larger and choicer asteroids. It concentrates on carbonaceous asteroids with easily accessible water, which equipment on the Fetchers splits into hydrogen and oxygen to fuel the engines. A few metal asteroids are brought in. Several are used to anchor the Anshar skyhook and the later skyhook constellation. By 5 years into this phase only asteroids over 100 kilotons are being returned, at a rate of dozens per year.  By 10 years in, they are several megatons each, coming in at the same rate.</p>
      <p>The Pod ships are mostly phased out in favor of Toss ships (discussed below), while the role of LNCs diversifies, and several types are built for different roles. Ones with very small engines serve the regular runs to the skyhooks, once the coil guns and slide strips take over most of the delta v burden. Ones with big engines do point to point transport whenever coil guns and strips can't be used. At the end of this phase, a few are <a href="https://www.moonwards.com/2017/08/25/The-Mothership.html">mother ships</a> - they are designed to safely transport pregnant women.</p>
      <details>
      <summary>Planetary Fleets</summary>
      <p>At the start of this phase, carbon nanotube cable starts being manufactured in bulk, and that means skyhooks get scattered through the solar system, creating the Interplanetary Network. Both things are discussed below. The traffic level it makes possible, especially from Mercury to the Asteroid Belt, means that each of the inner planets is given its own fleet. Mars and Venus each get several toss ships specialized for the separate routes they ply, and each has two Schooners assigned to it - those are ships like the Roddenberry, fast and powerful. The sailing ships of Mercury are discussed below. </p>
      <p>Callisto gets a set of LNC-type vessels for the Jovian system, a Schooner, and a couple of Toss ships as well. The Saturn system gets 2 LNCs, based on Rhea. 2 Galleons (Tripathi-class ships) serve those two systems, spending time around Jupiter or around Saturn as needed. A bunch of Galleons shuttle between the outer asteroid belt and the inner planets carrying water ice or metal. Psyche and Ceres get Toss ships of their own.</p>
      <p>Earth and the Moon are brimming with ships going here and there. They skip between the various space stations and skyhooks - transport vessels, private vessels, constructions ships, tugs and service vessels. Toss ships dominate. A fleet of Schooners accumulates.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Toss Ships</summary>
      <p>Once skyhooks come into their own, ships start being made that just go from one to the other, around different worlds. They carry fuel and engines only for the small amount of maneuvering and delta v needed to berth with the skyhooks at either end of their journey. Skyhooks all have Hoppers of their own, which rendezvous with incoming Toss ships and use their much larger engines to do deceleration and docking. As long as the Toss ships can get into a high orbit on their own, the Hoppers can do the rest.</p>
      <p>Toss ships are big, and scale up more as the phase progresses. Traffic of Toss ships also grows quickly. When the Venus, Mars, Mercury, and Earth skyhooks open, fully loaded Toss ships mass up to 12 kilotons and each skyhook can take one at a time. By the time it ends, they typically mass 30 kilotons when full, the biggest ones up to 100 kilotons. The 100 kt ships are known as Chukwa<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#chukwa">[?]</sup> class. The Skyhooks manage to carry that mass by ferrying arriving ships down the upper tether to the anchor station after they dock, and berthing them there. They sometimes are shepherded to a waystation closer to the anchor station, on skyhooks that normally don't receive Chukwas. The use of Hoppers as space tugs that help with deceleration and maneuvers makes this possible.</p>
      <p>Passenger Toss ships are globes with water shielding 3 to 5 m thick. Only the ones on the Earth - Moon run don't have that, just a solar storm shelter padded with the passengers' own luggage and a modicum of cargo. Toss ships for cargo either take cargo pods, or are designed to haul just ice. Cargo pods can be designed for people, but with all the space taken up by shielding, there is only room for a few people.</p>
      <p>Things that need to get where they are going quickly are placed on the smallest Toss ships, which can get more kick by releasing at a higher altitude, on the launch skyhooks. If they need to get there even faster, they go aboard Galleons, or even Schooners, for real emergencies. The giant Chukwas are the slow boats that let go from shorter tether cables so the cables don't have to be so huge to take the strain of holding them. Then they skip from skyhook to skyhook to reach their destination. </p>

      <summary>Busy Skies</summary>
      <p>So this phase sees the heavens filling with ships on all sorts of missions here and there. Too many missions to mention, and normal routine business that quickly is not worth regarding as a mission at all. Robots and AI are so reliable that ships doing cargo runs, mining, servicing, and even construction don't have any people aboard. Even passenger ships have a minimal crew, who don't do much besides maintaining a pleasant atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The Schooners travel far and wide through the solar system, visiting everywhere, leaving a trail of observation satellites and rovers in there wake. They even make it to a few Kuiper belt objects. Several probes are sent even further than that, out to the Oort cloud, and to dark Planet 9. Probes launched from Mercury plunge into the sun. People take sky cruises around the Earth and Moon. There are numerous space-based construction projects serviced by various spacecraft. There is so much traffic, that there is official traffic control for the Earth Moon system. </p>

      <summary><h5>Carbon Nanotube (CNT) Cable</h5></summary>
      <p>Aside from the explosion in activity caused by advanced robotics, CNT cable is the thing that makes this all possible. It also has a profound impact on architecture. In fact, bulk, high quality CNTs have deep implications in almost every technology sector, as does graphene, which should also be producable in bulk if CNTs are. </p>
      <p>The most promising technique for bulk production of extremely long CNTs is widely considered to be chemical vapor deposition. Processes of that kind are likely to benefit from a microgravity environment, which greatly changes fluid dynamics, and a hard vacuum, which makes it easier to produce chemicals of extremely high purity. Here we posit that once humanity manages to fabricate this material in bulk, it can be counted on to have a tensile strength of 30 GPa. Carbon nanotubes have a bulk density of 1.3 to 1.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. (A matrix of another material might be needed to bind them together, but the density of that shouldn't be any higher). This is an estimate of the material properties of the first carbon nanotube cables.<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#CNT">[?]</sup> To model a skyhook system, it was necessary to choose numbers for these values. It should be noted that as manufacturing techniques advance, it is reasonable to suppose that tensile strengths as high as 100 GPa will be attained. Currently exotic methods, such as cross-linking the nanotubes to produce threads made solely of CNTs, may one day become feasible on an industrial scale.</p>

      <div class="tooltip_templates">
        <span id="CNT">
        The tensile strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes ranges from 11 to 150 GPa in experimental results. Defects in the atomic lattice are what lowers this strength.

      <summary><h5>The Skyhook Interplanetary Network (SIN)</h5></summary>
      <p>Skyhooks are erected all over during this phase. Trips throughout the solar system almost always involve at least one, usually two, and often three. Those for Earth, and the rejigging of the ones for the Moon, are discussed in later subsections. Of the ones in the following list, those at Mars and Venus are constructed first, then Mercury, and finally in order going further outwards from the sun. What takes the longest is transport time of the materials. The CNT cables are so massive it takes several trips to get the whole things to their destinations. This is less of a factor with the inner planets as trip times are shorter and launch windows more frequent.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Surface and Launch Skyhook Pairs</summary>
      <p> Skyhooks are often specialized for either surface operations, or launch operations. The worlds of the inner solar system all have at least one of each. Surface skyhooks have achor masses that orbit higher, so the speed of their foot platforms is slower relative to the surface. That lowers the energy needed to reach the foot platform, or land from there. Launch skyhooks have anchors that orbit lower to take greater advantage of the gravity well of their primary. </p>
      <p>Each launch skyhook is paired to a surface skyhook with a matching, slightly inclined equatorial orbit, offset by 20&deg; or so. They are in orbital resonance with a ratio of 3:1, 5:1, or 7:1. For instance, the Venus surface skyhook orbits once for each 7 orbits of the launch skyhook. So, at any given altitude, the launch skyhook is moving 7 times the speed of the surface skyhook. </p>
      <p>The upper tether of a launch skyhook masses 10% to 20% less than the upper tether of a skyhook that combines both surface and launch duties. For interplanetary skyhooks, upper tethers are by far the heaviest, as they bear payloads many times heavier than a lower tether, and are also much longer. The cable mass savings of building paired skyhooks remains significant even though there are 4 tethers instead of 2, and the extra tethers add very useful capacity.</p>
      <p>The savings are multiplied by handling Chukwas entirely on the surface skyhook. The upper tethers of these skyhooks are much shorter, with just enough range to get a Chukwa to the next hop on their trip. If the 100 kt behemoths stick to that skyhook, and the launch skyhook handles ships massing no more than 30 kt, that cable can mass 30% of what it otherwise would. That's the cable that makes up the lion's share of the mass of all the cables.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Optimizing Inner Solar System Traffic</summary>
      <p> The Chukwas are the ones that often use 3 or even 4 skyhooks to get to where they are going. They are too heavy to be thrown directly to their destination, they have to hop from planet to planet. Hoppers are used to refine their trajectory (and optionally give them a speed boost) after launch from a skyhook, and to go out and meet them on approach, decelerate them, and bring them in for docking. They could travel using negligable fuel, but they have enough fuel and engines to enter a high elliptical orbit around their destination on their own, just to be sure they can't accidentally whizz by and be difficult to rescue. It might take a while for a world to be in range for a decent trajectory, but launch windows can really be stretched by vessels releasing from somewhat higher on the tether than is needed for that destination, so the ship is going faster after release. Also, to go from Venus to Earth or vice versa, it's often faster to launch to Mercury, and then go from Mercury to either planet. Launch windows to either place occur on Mercury usually 3 times a year, whereas launch windows between Earth and Venus happen about every year and a half. There is a greater plane-change to deal with in the case of Mercury, as its orbit is inclined 7&deg; to the ecliptic, but inclining the orbit of the Mercury skyhooks the right way can largely handle that. </p>
      <p>Once there is enough traffic that there is more than one ship on a skyhook at a time, incoming ships need to be ferried down to the anchor station and berthed there until it is time for them to leave. That's generally the best way to do things anyhow, though it's easiest if a ship is unloaded before being ferried, so the cable car doesn't have to haul so much at once. It makes loading and maintenance much easier, and passengers can go back and forth from their ship to the anchor station at will.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Managing Orbits</summary>
      <p>At first, the anchor masses of these skyhooks aren't very big. Once they are set up, their fleet of Hoppers, LNCs, and a couple of Fetchers, get to work adding mass to the anchor whenever possible. Maintaining their orbits takes a lot more fuel and trickery with passive masses until the anchors are many times heavier than the heaviest ships that come and go. The Fetchers go after anything that comes in range on a convenient trajectory, the LNCs use all their spare time to ferry mass made of whatever to the foot platform, to be taken up and added to the anchor. The pace doesn't slow until even Chukwas are dwarfed by the anchors. They need to be at least a few megatons.</p>
    </details>



      <details>
        <summary>Skyhooks of the SIN</summary>
        <p>All of these skyhooks are made of CNT cable. The figures shown are for the configuration attained by the end of this Phase. All of them will be operating long before that, but with less capacity. As more cable is woven into the tethers, capacity increaases. </p>
        <details>
          <summary>Tabe Details</summary>
        <p>In the rows that show tether mass, this is the mass of just the CNT cable. Those numbers show the mass first in kilotons, and then in the brackets, as what multiple it is of the payload mass. Roughly 15% of the payload mass should be added on top of it to account for the mass of the climber, the foot platform, and all the infrastructure on the tether for maintenance and power transmission. That is not included for simplicity.</p>
        <p>These figures use a safety factor of 2. That factor accounts for what a tether needs to operate safely even despite wear and tear, manufacturing defects, and damage due to any micrometeoroid strikes. Safety factor of 2 means the taper ratio used is the square of what it would be if it was just barely enough to bear the loads on it. In that case, even if the cable's tensile strength was reduced by half, it would still be just strong enough to bear the weight on it. All skyhooks are made of an open weave of cables known as a 'Hoytether' weave, after Robert Hoyt of Tethers Unlimited. That design makes it easy for maintenance carts to weave in new cables when they detect a weakness on a cable. This may mean that a lower safety factor would be just fine. The mass of a tether changes drastically with a change in safety factor, so that would be a big help. Thus bear in mind that as in all things here, this number is estimated on the conservative side. </p>

          The Mercury colony will be at the north pole, so the surface skyhook has a polar orbit.

Even then, its lower tether would only be able to support 3 kt, while the lower tether of the launch skyhook can bear 10 kt, albeit its foot is moving much faster and likely there are few cases where it makes sense to use that tether. Not only does a skyhook pair take less material, a spacecraft going up from the anchor station to launch from the launch skyhook only needs to travel half as far. There are twice as many berths, and 8 times as many launch opportunities. It might be a bit tricky to hop from the surface skyhook to the launch skyhook and vice versa, and it takes a little fuel. Overall though, a big plus to have skyhook pairs instead of one that does it all.

      <summary><h5>Anshar Skyhook</h5></summary>
      <p>Anshar is the first skyhook built out of CNT cable. That cable was spun in Gibraltar's manufacturing sphere using carbon extracted from carbonaceous asteroids. Soon after the skyhook opens, manufacture is set up in a facility constructed on its anchor mass. That facility then provides the cable for expanding Anshar, and for the rest of the skyhook constellation around Earth that springs up over the coming years.</p>
      <p>The initial anchor mass is a metal asteroid massing 300 kt, and then carbonaceous asteroids are tacked onto that. Within 2 years the anchor masses over 2 megatons. An impressive complement of VASIMR and Neumann drives are attached to its tip platform and its anchor. In addition to solar panels, there is a nuclear reactor providing electricity for the drives. That reactor can also power nuclear thermal LANTR engines in an emergency for quick orbital corrections or avoidance maneuvers.</p>
      <p>As the Van Allen belts have been drained, they are no issue for Anshar.</p>
