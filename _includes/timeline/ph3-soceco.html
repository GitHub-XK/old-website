      <summary>A New and Unique Culture</summary>
    <p>The residents begin to form a culture of their own. Their environment has caused them to quickly develop unique customs - in sports, crafts, cuisine, fashion, dance, hobbies. A few examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The two weeks of night at Cernan's Promise stimulated the development of customs to adapt to that, as it feels so unnatural. At Full Earth, which is lunar midnight, when the Earth is fully lit, they tended to gather to gaze at it, and quickly realized it was a good time to tell stories. After that Full Earth became a time to do that, complete with snacks and drinks customary to the event. They set up a campfire to gather around for that (a small one burning pure alcohol, as smoke is a serious nuisance and there is little appropriate fuel).</li>
      <li>It is easy to move quickly on the Moon, the problem is stopping, and turning. Gravity is much lower, but inertia remains the same, making these maneuvers complex. People take to making and carrying specialized canes that help with this, so they can easily move fast in a controlled manner. The canes end up being useful for doing fancy lunar parkour maneuvers as well, which have become very common. People take to making very fancy, personalized and customized canes.</li>
      <li>Insects continue to be an invaluable source of protein and fat, but people also continue to be rather resistent to eating them. They taste good, but the tastiest ones also tend to be the ones that are hardest to accept - grubs, pupae, caterpillars. People develop recipes for grinding them up and making sausages and patties that feel a lot more acceptable, or toasting them dry and making a sort of flour that then is used to make fillings for savory pastries, or as an ingredient in loaves and cakes.</li>
      <li>Architectural design is highly important to the residents, as their lives are spent almost entirely in a pretty restricted space missing many aspects of Earthly nature. They have strong opinions about it. People often spend their spare time in group activities that detail, enhance, or renovate all sorts of structures - gardens, walkways, fountains, lamp posts and lighting fixtures, their shared kitchens and eating areas, their shared baths, public art. This is greatly helped by the ease of having complex items fabricated, and their intimate familiarity with those techniques. But, they often prefer to carve, weave, paint, or sculpt things by hand. Just because.</li>
      <li>They become quite fearless of heights. They develop a strong tendency to place things high up walls or in very tall shelves - including their homes. If they need to reach something high, they stand on someone's shoulders. Or on the shoulders of someone who is standing on someone else's shoulders, who may even be standing on the shoulders of a fourth person. They really like their open spaces, spaces that feel large enough to be a little like being outside, so they maximize open space as much as they can, with this stacking approach.</li>
      <li>They start to enjoy a casual passtime of water-tossing. This is the act of tossing a mug or a bucket of some fluid, usually water, between people who may be several meters apart. The low gravity gives people time to line up a recipient to properly catch the liquid, and allows that liquid to remain more cohesive, instead of splitting into droplets. There is of course an art to it, which keeps it interesting.</li>
    </ul>

    <summary>Robotic Society</summary>
    <p>The Moon has become the place with the highest density of robots anywhere, and they are used for everything. Many chosen residents are specialists in robotics. Their work on improving them leads to advances that are also used on Earth. The Moon population becomes very adept and creating systems for robots to do things efficiently, quickly, and well. The populace develops the habits that used to be the domain only of people who had personal staffs, meaning the very wealthy. Many robots are so sophisticated they are treated not very differently than servants. They are given verbal instructions and respond verbally, they modify their behavior in real time and usually adapt it to an unforseen event or factor without needing to consult anyone. They can even work in teams. This impacts the psychology of the residents deeply. In broad terms, their behavior aligns most closely to the aristocracy in Europe at the peak of the Industrial Revolution - they restrict themselves to intellectual pursuits, have exacting standards, and are used to ordering people around - even though now they are ordering robots, not actual people. </p>

  <details>
    <summary>The Beginning of Tribe Society</summary>
    <p>Residents continue to train together in groups of 20 or 30 people before they go to the Moon, and to continue to organize themselves around shared kitchens, baths, and laundry facilities. About half-way through this period, this stops being because there is any need to do this. It's because they prefer to do this. Robots do the drudgery anyhow - they clean up after cooking and eating, wash the clothes, fold them, and put them away, sweep the floor, all that sort of thing. So, it is rather nice for people to gather, cook together, and eat together, just as a social activity. Since there are no children, people feel a broader need for contact like this. </p>
    <p>People now mostly put a small kitchen and bathroom in their homes. The toilets work without water, so the waste is easily collected for processing for the gardens or for topsoil production. The robots do that, no biggie. The robots also usually are the ones who refill the water tank for the shower and sink, every day or two. And they switch out the ice packs in the ice-boxes, and clean the microwave and the grill, or what have you. Some people like to do that themselves. Or they just go to the shared baths and eat always in the shared kitchens, just a quick sandwich if need be.</p>
    <p>The baths are more for long soaks or a good sweat, with friends or on your own. There you can bathe in style. They have become adept at creating giant thermoses, basically - molded shapes with a vacuum in their core. Great for tubs or saunas that hold their heat. And hot water is no problem at all, use as much as you want. Cold water too, same thing. Baths and saunas take on the role they have in traditional Japan or Sweden. They remain held in common, so they can be grand and fancy, and people can enjoy sharing the experience.</p>
    <p>The sense of shared identity in these small groups becomes so strong, colonists simply refer to them as tribes. Usually each tribe is composed of the people who trained together before they came to the Moon, but sometimes people switch tribes. (If they do, usually they move their house with them. Not just the contents, the actual house.) Tribe members have a very high level of ongoing contact with each other, and make many decisions as a group - how the kitchen, bath, and dining areas should be, where homes should be, landscaping, group meal decisions, group events. In the next phase, this becomes the basis for the lunar version of democracy and law. </p>

    <summary><h5>The Moon Agency</h5></summary>
    <p>The colonies have become entities that really should govern themselves. Their awareness of the environment they live in, and the tools at their disposal, is so much greater than the ISA, and the colonies are so complex, it is agreed that administration of all lunar installations should be by the people who live there. The local leaders remain bound by the Space Settlement Treaty. That treaty has now been ratified by and extended to almost all nations, as they almost all have astronauts up there.  </p>
    <p>The SST makes it easier to decide to grant control directly to the colonists. The colonies are quickly becoming a seat of power. By the end of this phase, everyone can see that. The great good fortune is that the policies of openness and sharing that were established from the outset and have been carefully strengthened over time means that the Earth is comfortable granting the Moon direct control over all that power.</p>
    <p>Their intellectual property has always been open source according to the treaty. They are accustomed to that and have no issue with it. So the nations of Earth don't fear loss of access to the technology developed through the colonies. The SST is also iron-clad regarding access to information about the colonys' activities. Aside from the private lives of the colonists, virtually all events in the colonies are monitored closely and that data is public, and instantly available. If the colonists do anything upsetting, everyone will know right away. Robotic control has also in the end made things more secure. The programming of those robots is public record, everyone knows what they are programmed to do. Nobody can change that programming on their own, it has to go through a process. The Robots were designed very, very carefully for it not to be possible to reprogram them outside of that process. In the spirit of Asimov's Three Laws, it is also not possible to make them do something destructive. (They still don't think for themselves, they are fancy automatons, so that is still a feasible proposition. We can talk later about the thinkers.) So, the Roddenberry isn't going to go rogue, the Fetchers won't send an asteroid crashing into Versailles, and the skyhooks can't be used to rain a series of giant metal spikes made of asteroid stuff into an active volcano, just to see what will happen. </p>
    <p>It is still through the ISA (which itself has grown a lot, to include many more members and an advisory council with representatives of most of the world's nations) that the missions of the Moon Agency are decided. The colonies simply carry those missions out, under the Moon Agency's direction. What this change mostly means is that the local population decides when and how things are done, and the people of Earth no longer have any say over matters that are strictly local. What exactly constitutes 'strictly local' is sometimes a bone of contention. Generally, it is agreed that the colonists can decide themselves how to use all the resources they need to live and prosper, and can run all the facilities based in space however they see fit, as long as they comply with their duty to provide open access and report all activity. </p>
    <p>The matter that needs to be changed during this phase, is how resources acquired in space are distributed, which is discussed under Privatization and The Moon Fund.</p>
    <p>For the first 5 years, upper management of the Moon Agency is locked as being the people who held those posts when the ISA converts the administrative structure from being under their control, to being the Moon Agency. At that point, the colonists may decide who holds those posts, and may decide how it is decided, and restructure things if they wish. Hiring and firing for lower positions is done by those managers.</p>

    <summary><h5>Broadcasting and its Impact</h5></summary>
    <p>From the beginning the colonists have regularly broadcast shows back to Earth. This has always been one of the conditions of being a resident. A bunch of these shows become quite popular on Earth, even during phase 1. There is a range of them, in many languages. Many residents also do extra shows on their own time, usually video blogs.</p>
    <p>That was the plan from the beginning. It goes a long way to maintaining high public support for the program, and is widely recognized as the principal source of a cultural shift around the globe towards an emphasis on science, and a decrease in nationalist sentiment.</p>
    <p>The most popular shows are sports. These sports are unlike anything on Earth, taking full advantage of the low gravity. Once the long dome habitat at the bottom of Cernan's Promise is complete (now referred to as the Trilobite Hab for its shape) an aerial sport is created. The players fly, flapping their wings by pumping their legs, adjusting wing shape with controls in their hands to maneuver. Their movement beomes closely analogous to that of birds. At first they hold aerial races, obstacle courses, and games of tag, later they develop a ball sport with aerial teams.</p>
    <p>Lots of other kinds of shows are popular too. People on Earth see the colonists interacting with each other, expressing themselves, and living their lives, often in detail. Many become pop icons with real influence, especially those from small countries and developing countries. A lot of colonists earn money in their spare time through the shows they produce themselves, appearances they make in other shows (by virtual presence), products marketed on their popularity, endorsements, or artwork and memorabilia they send back to Earth for sale.</p>
    <p>A lot of the money they earn stays on Earth. They use it to back ventures they have an interest in or help out their families. The rest is for having luxuries shipped to them. This mostly involves foods that are in short supply on the Moon (chocolate, cheese, fine liquor and wine, beef, seafood), fine clothing and jewelery, furnishings, and personal electronics. The food, clothing, and goods shipped up by the ISA are high quality and include some of all the listed luxuries, plus favorite items for each resident. But more and better is always welcome.</p>
    <p>Fashions from the Moon spread to Earth. Interest in science education is at an all-time high. Belligerent posturing in politics is at an all-time low. This is all thanks to the intimate contact the people of Earth have with the colonists. The fact the program has led to many advances in technology and science supports this dynamic a lot. In particular, it's clear that even with the vast investments made to build the colonies and the transport systems in space, the break-even point is not far away. Everybody loves space now.</p>

    <summary><h5>Privatization and The Moon Fund</h5></summary>
    <p>More or less everything that has happened up to this point was anticipated when the Space Settlement Treaty was finalized. It was written into the treaty that once commerce and industry in space reached certain milestones,  industry would be privatized, and then the Moon Fund would be created. Towards the end of this phase, that happens.</p>
    <p>First, privatization. This makes it necessary to distinguish between what is business, and what is essential services. Essential services are administered by the Moon Agency. That consists of telecommunications, transport, utilities, medical services, information services, farming, and ecosystem development for the common good. That is to say, what is needed to provide all the basic needs of all people on the Moon - including visitors. The definition of a basic need is whatever is required to ensure a person is a fully contributing member of society. So, it goes beyond providing basic food, to providing healthy food. It goes beyond providing emergency medical care, to providing complete medical care. However, the Moon Agency owns very little. It contracts almost everything. It is authorized to negotiate contracts with all the public corporations created during this phase, for the portion of their services or products it requires to fulfill its mandate. It doesn't pay for those goods and services, it takes delivery of a portion of total output, the way tax used to be done in fiefs. </p>
    <p>This system is possible for two reasons. One, because from the outset everything has been set up to be monitored very carefully and put on public record. Those records are meticulous, complete, accessible, and verifiable. Two, because so much of everything is computerized and roboticized, it hardly matters how much demand there is for different resources. All of them are bountiful. If the surplus of something starts getting low, the robots make more robots that then go make more surplus.</p>
    <p>Food is the one thing the Moon still can't supply all of for all its residents and visitors. But all the residents have a lifetime deal saying they get looked after, the ISA is on the hook for that. And the visitors are all either very wealthy or very valuable. Anyways, the Moon now provides about 80% of its own food, and could provide all of it if they set aside research on ecosystem development, park space, and plant breeding experiments.</p>
    <p>What the Moon Agency doesn't reserve for fulfillment of its mandate is sold on the open market. That is the portion that is considered 'business'. At this stage, it basically amounts to anything done for export. That includes ships, satellites and stations, any goods going to the Earth and its environs, power beamed to Earth or Earth assets (there have been a few small cases of that), transport, and all interplanetary missions. The interplanetary missions are under the auspices of the ISA, which pays the Moon Agency for the ships and the use of the Moon's infrastructure. Information is free. There might at times be a charge for transmitting it, calculating it, or collecting the data (like telescope time), but there is no charge for the actual information.</p>
    <p>Wherever it made sense, the public corporations have been divided up to maximize the potential for competition. For instance, each skyhook is a separate corporation. Just about all major infrastructure is privatized. Medical facilities, greenhouses, the core computer system, ecosystem research, monitoring sensors and cameras, and pure research facilities such as Sagan telescope, are not privatized.</p>
    <p>The Moon Fund is established to handle everything that involves currency, which is the same as saying all business with Earth. It is a very touchy subject that was negotiated with great care but was never going to be easy. The Moon Fund holds a certain percentage of the shares in all the corporations, so that the profit realized by those corporations can be distributed back to the entities that built that infrastructure. Those shares expire once a certain amount has been earned on them. The Moon Agency also holds a small number of shares so that it has access to currency on the occasions it needs to buy things from Earth.</p>
    <p>Land on the Moon is only leased, never sold. Leases may be granted for up to a century. Leases must be approved by both the ISA and the Moon Agency. Payments are made to a subsecton of the Moon Fund, the Project Fund. Those funds may only be spent on space infrastructure projects. Those projects are also chosen by the ISA and the Moon Agency.</p>
