      <summary>A New and Unique Culture</summary>
    <p>The residents begin to form a culture of their own. Their environment has caused them to quickly develop unique customs - in sports, crafts, cuisine, fashion, dance, hobbies. A few examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The two weeks of night at Cernan's Promise stimulated the development of customs to adapt to that, as it feels so unnatural. At Full Earth, which is lunar midnight, when the Earth is fully lit, they tended to gather to gaze at it, and quickly realized it was a good time to tell stories. After that Full Earth became a time to do that, complete with snacks and drinks customary to the event. They set up a campfire to gather around for that (a small one burning pure alcohol, as smoke is a serious nuisance and there is little appropriate fuel).</li>
      <li>It is easy to move quickly on the Moon, the problem is stopping, and turning. Gravity is much lower, but inertia remains the same, making these maneuvers complex. People take to making and carrying specialized canes that help with this, so they can easily move fast in a controlled manner. The canes end up being useful for doing fancy lunar parkour maneuvers as well, which have become very common. People take to making very fancy, personalized and customized canes.</li>
      <li>Insects and worms continue to be an invaluable source of protein and fat, but people also continue to be rather resistent to eating them. They taste good, but the tastiest ones also tend to be the ones that are hardest to accept - grubs, pupae, worms. People develop recipes for grinding them up and making sausages and patties that feel a lot more acceptable, or toasting them dry and making a sort of flour that then is used to make fillings for savory pastries, or as an ingredient in loaves and cakes.</li>
      <li>Architectural design is highly important to the residents, as their lives are spent almost entirely in a pretty restricted space missing many aspects of Earthly nature. They have strong opinions about it. People often spend their spare time in group activities that detail, enhance, or renovate all sorts of structures - gardens, walkways, fountains, lamp posts and lighting fixtures, their shared kitchens and eating areas, their shared baths, public art. This is greatly helped by the ease of having complex items fabricated, and their intimate familiarity with those techniques. But, they often prefer to carve, weave, paint, or sculpt things by hand. Just because.</li>
      <li>They become quite fearless of heights. They develop a strong tendency to place things high up walls or in very tall shelves - including their homes. If they need to reach something high, they stand on someone's shoulders. Or on the shoulders of someone who is standing on someone else's shoulders, who may even be standing on the shoulders of a fourth person. They really like their open spaces, spaces that feel large enough to be a little like being outside, so they maximize open space as much as they can, with this stacking approach.</li>
      <li>They start to enjoy a casual passtime of water-tossing. This is the act of tossing a mug or a bucket of some fluid, usually water, between people who may be several meters apart. The low gravity gives people time to line up a recipient to properly catch the liquid, and allows that liquid to remain more cohesive, instead of splitting into droplets. There is of course an art to it, which keeps it interesting.</li>
    </ul>

    <summary>Robotic Society</summary>
    <p>The Moon has become the place with the highest density of robots anywhere, and they are used for everything. Many chosen residents are specialists in robotics. Their work on improving them leads to advances that are also used on Earth. The Moon population becomes very adept and creating systems for robots to do things efficiently, quickly, and well. The populace develops the habits that used to be the domain only of people who had personal staffs, meaning the very wealthy. Many robots are so sophisticated they are treated not very differently than servants. They are given verbal instructions and respond verbally, they modify their behavior in real time and usually adapt it to an unforseen event or factor without needing to consult anyone. They can even work in teams. This impacts the psychology of the residents deeply. In broad terms, their behavior aligns most closely to the aristocracy in Europe at the peak of the Industrial Revolution - they restrict themselves to intellectual pursuits, have exacting standards, and are used to ordering people around - even though now they are ordering robots, not actual people. </p>

    <summary>The Beginning of Tribe Society</summary>
    <p>Residents continue to train together in groups of 20 or 30 people before they go to the Moon, and to continue to organize themselves around shared kitchens, baths, and laundry facilities. About half-way through this period, this stops being because there is any need to do this. It's because they prefer to do this. Robots do the drudgery anyhow - they clean up after cooking and eating, wash the clothes, fold them, and put them away, sweep the floor, all that sort of thing. So, it is rather nice for people to gather, cook together, and eat together, just as a social activity. Since there are no children, people feel a broader need for contact like this. </p>
    <p>People now mostly put a small kitchen and bathroom in their homes. The toilets work without water, so the waste is easily collected for processing for the gardens or for topsoil production. The robots do that, no biggie. The robots also usually are the ones who refill the water tank for the shower and sink, every day or two. And they switch out the ice packs in the ice-boxes, and clean the microwave and the grill, or what have you. Some people like to do that themselves. Or they just go to the shared baths and eat always in the shared kitchens, just a quick sandwich if need be.</p>
    <p>The baths are more for long soaks or a good sweat, with friends or on your own. There you can bathe in style. They have become adept at creating giant thermoses, basically - molded shapes with a vacuum in their core. Great for tubs or saunas that hold their heat. And hot water is no problem at all, use as much as you want. Cold water too, same thing. Baths and saunas take on the role they have in traditional Japan or Sweden. They remain held in common, so they can be grand and fancy, and people can enjoy sharing the experience.</p>

    <summary><h5>The Moon Agency</h5></summary>
    <p>The colonies have become entities that really should govern themselves. Their awareness of the environment they live in, and the tools at their disposal, is so much greater than the ISA, and the colonies are so complex, it is agreed that administration of all lunar installations should be by the people who live there. The local leaders remain bound by the treaty written to govern all cis-lunar activities by the ISA nations. That treaty has now been ratified by and extended to almost all nations, as they almost all have astronauts up there.  </p>
    <p>That treaty makes it easier to decide to grant control directly to the colonists. The colonies are quickly becoming a seat of power. By the end of this phase, everyone can see that. The great good fortune is that the policies of openness and sharing that were established from the outset and have been carefully strengthened over time means that the Earth is comfortable granting the Moon direct control over all that power.</p>
    <p>Their intellectual property has always been open source according to the treaty. They are accustomed to that and have no issue with it. So the nations of Earth don't fear loss of access to the technology developed through the colonies. The treaty is also iron-clad regarding access to information about the colonys' activities. Aside from the private lives of the colonists, virtually all events in the colonies are monitored closely and that data is public, and instantly available. If the colonists do anything upsetting, everyone will know right away. Robotic control has also in the end made things more secure. The programming of those robots is public record, everyone knows what they are programmed to do. Nobody can change that programming on their own, it has to go through a process. The Robots were designed very, very carefully for it not to be possible to reprogram them outside of that process. In the spirit of Asimov's Three Laws, it is also not possible to make them do something destructive. (They still don't think for themselves, they are fancy automatons, so that is still a feasible proposition. We can talk later about the thinkers.) So, the Roddenberry isn't going to go rogue, The Fetchers won't send an asteroid crashing into Versailles, and the skyhooks can't be used to rain a series of giant metallic spikes made of asteroid stuff into an active volcano, just to see what will happen. </p>
    <p>It is still through the ISA (which itself has grown a lot, to include many more members and an advisory council with representatives of most of the world's nations) that the missions of the Moon Agency are decided. The colonies simply carry those missions out, under the Moon Agency's direction. What this change mostly means is that the local population decides when and how things are done, and the people of Earth no longer have any say over matters that are strictly local. What exactly constitutes 'strictly local' is sometimes a bone of contention. Generally, it is agreed that the colonists can decide themselves how to use all the resources they need to live and prosper, and can run all the facilities based in space however they see fit, as long as they comply with their duty to provide open access and report all activity. </p>
    <p>The matter that needs to be changed during this phase, is how resources acquired in space are distributed, which is discussed under The Moon Fund and Privatization</p>
