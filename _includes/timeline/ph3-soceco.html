      <summary>A New and Unique Culture</summary>
    <p>The residents begin to form a culture of their own. Their environment has caused them to quickly develop unique customs - in sports, crafts, cuisine, fashion, dance, hobbies. A few examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The two weeks of night at Cernan's Promise stimulated the development of customs to adapt to that, as it feels so unnatural. At Full Earth, which is lunar midnight, when the Earth is fully lit, they tended to gather to gaze at it, and quickly realized it was a good time to tell stories. After that Full Earth became a time to do that, complete with snacks and drinks customary to the event. They set up a campfire to gather around for that (a small one burning pure alcohol, as smoke is a serious nuisance and there is little appropriate fuel).</li>
      <li>It is easy to move quickly on the Moon, the problem is stopping, and turning. Gravity is much lower, but inertia remains the same, making these maneuvers complex. People take to making and carrying specialized canes that help with this, so they can easily move fast in a controlled manner. The canes end up being useful for doing fancy lunar parkour maneuvers as well, which have become very common. People take to making very fancy, personalized and customized canes.</li>
      <li>Insects continue to be an invaluable source of protein and fat, but people also continue to be rather resistant to eating them. They taste good, but the tastiest ones also tend to be the ones that are hardest to accept - grubs, pupae, caterpillars. People develop recipes for grinding them up and making sausages and patties that feel a lot more acceptable, or toasting them dry and making a sort of flour that then is used to make fillings for savory pastries, or as an ingredient in loaves and cakes.</li>
      <li>Architectural design is highly important to the residents, as their lives are spent almost entirely in a pretty restricted space missing many aspects of Earthly nature. They have strong opinions about it. People often spend their spare time in group activities that detail, enhance, or renovate all sorts of structures - gardens, walkways, fountains, lamp posts and lighting fixtures, their shared kitchens and eating areas, their shared baths, public art. This is greatly helped by the ease of having complex items fabricated, and their intimate familiarity with those techniques. But, they often prefer to carve, weave, paint, or sculpt things by hand. Just because.</li>
      <li>They become quite fearless of heights. They develop a strong tendency to place things high up walls or in very tall shelves - including their homes. If they need to reach something high, they stand on someone's shoulders. Or on the shoulders of someone who is standing on someone else's shoulders, who may even be standing on the shoulders of a fourth person. They really like their open spaces, spaces that feel large enough to be a little like being outside, so they maximize open space as much as they can, with this stacking approach.</li>
      <li>They start to enjoy a casual passtime of water-tossing. This is the act of tossing a mug or a bucket of some fluid, usually water, between people who may be several meters apart. The low gravity gives people time to line up a recipient to properly catch the liquid, and allows that liquid to remain more cohesive, instead of splitting into droplets. There is of course an art to it, which keeps it interesting.</li>
    </ul>

    <summary>Robotic Society</summary>
    <p>The Moon has become the place with the highest density of robots anywhere, and they are used for everything. Many chosen residents are specialists in robotics. Their work on improving them leads to advances that are also used on Earth. The Moon population becomes very adept at creating systems for robots to do things efficiently, quickly, and well. The populace develops the habits that used to be the domain only of people who had personal staffs, meaning the very wealthy. Many robots are so sophisticated they are treated not very differently than servants. They are given verbal instructions and respond verbally, they modify their behavior in real time and usually adapt it to an unforeseen event or factor without needing to consult anyone. They can even work in teams. This impacts the psychology of the residents deeply. In broad terms, their behavior aligns most closely to the aristocracy in Europe at the peak of the Industrial Revolution - they restrict themselves to intellectual pursuits, have exacting standards, and are used to ordering people around - even though now they are ordering robots, not actual people. </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>The Beginning of Tribe Society</summary>
    <p>Residents continue to train together in groups of 20 or 30 people before they go to the Moon, and to continue to organize themselves around shared kitchens, baths, and laundry facilities. About half-way through this period, this stops being because there is any need to do this. It's because they prefer to do this. Robots do the drudgery anyhow - they clean up after cooking and eating, wash the clothes, fold them, and put them away, sweep the floor, all that sort of thing. So, it is rather nice for people to gather, cook together, and eat together, just as a social activity. Since there are no children, people feel a broader need for contact like this. </p>
    <p>People now mostly put a small kitchen and bathroom in their homes. The toilets work without water, so the waste is easily collected for processing for the gardens or for topsoil production. The robots do that, no biggie. The robots also usually are the ones who refill the water tank for the shower and sink, every day or two. And they switch out the ice packs in the ice-boxes, and clean the microwave and the grill, or what have you. Some people like to do that themselves. Or they just go to the shared baths and eat always in the shared kitchens, just a quick sandwich if need be.</p>
    <p>The baths are more for long soaks or a good sweat, with friends or on your own. There you can bathe in style. They have become adept at creating giant thermoses, basically - molded shapes with a vacuum in their core. Great for tubs or saunas that hold their heat. And hot water is no problem at all, use as much as you want. Cold water too, same thing. Baths and saunas take on the role they have in traditional Japan or Sweden. They remain held in common, so they can be grand and fancy, and people can enjoy sharing the experience.</p>
    <p>The sense of shared identity in these small groups becomes so strong, colonists simply refer to them as tribes. Usually each tribe is composed of the people who trained together before they came to the Moon, but sometimes people switch tribes. (If they do, usually they move their house with them. Not just the contents, the actual house.) Tribe members have a very high level of ongoing contact with each other, and make many decisions as a group - how the kitchen, bath, and dining areas should be, where homes should be, landscaping, group meal decisions, group events. In the next phase, this becomes the basis for the lunar version of democracy and law. </p>

    <summary><h5>The Moon Agency</h5></summary>
    <p>The colonies have become entities that really should govern themselves. Their awareness of the environment they live in, and the tools at their disposal, is so much greater than the ISA, and the colonies are so complex, it is agreed that administration of all lunar installations should be by the people who live there. The local leaders remain bound by the Space Settlement Treaty. That treaty has now been ratified by and extended to almost all nations, as they almost all have astronauts up there.  </p>
    <p>The SST makes it easier to decide to grant control directly to the colonists. The colonies are quickly becoming a seat of power. By the end of this phase, everyone can see that. The great good fortune is that the policies of openness and sharing that were established from the outset and have been carefully strengthened over time means that the Earth is comfortable granting the Moon direct control over all that power.</p>
    <p>Their intellectual property has always been open source according to the treaty. They are accustomed to that and have no issue with it. So the nations of Earth don't fear loss of access to the technology developed through the colonies. The SST is also iron-clad regarding access to information about the colonies' activities. Aside from the private lives of the colonists, virtually all events in the colonies are monitored closely and that data is public, and instantly available. If the colonists do anything upsetting, everyone will know right away. Robotic control has also in the end made things more secure. The programming of those robots is public record, everyone knows what they are programmed to do. Nobody can change that programming on their own, it has to go through a process. The robots were designed very, very carefully for it not to be possible to reprogram them outside of that process. In the spirit of Asimov's Three Laws, it is also not possible to make them do something destructive. (They still don't think for themselves, they are fancy automatons, so that is still a feasible proposition.) </p>
    <details>
      <summary><h5>Local Administration</h5></summary>
      <p>The MA now runs all the infrastructure in space, much of which is important to businesses and institutions on Earth. Under the Space Settlement Treaty, the MA must keep all the things previously administered by the ISA working properly - the skyhooks and their fleets, all the satellites, telescopes, sensor networks, power plants, and utilities used by Earth-based concerns. As long as they do that, nobody else has any say in what they do.
      </p>
      <p>The deal for lifetime provision of all necessities the residents had with the ISA now falls on the shoulders of the Moon Agency. Their income from the Moon Fund is meant to cover that, as well as providing funds to satisfy their SST obligations. In addition, they charge for lease of land on the Moon, contracting such leases for a period of between one and one hundred years.
      </p>
      <p>The Moon Agency chooses to keep the essentials of life free for all people in the colonies. There is almost nobody around they could charge for them anyways, as the residents are exempt. It was the residents who built all the infrastructure of the colonies, and now they keep it running and upgrade it. It was intentionally designed to be open and they very much want to keep it that way.
      </p>
      <p>So, although such essential things as farming, air and water treatment, power, and communications are now all done by private companies, a large part of their output is bought by the Moon Agency, who then does not charge for public use of it. The highly automated nature of these operations makes this an easy thing to manage - the Moon Agency doesn't expend much of its resources guaranteeing the essentials, and there is no lack. The pervasive monitoring the colonies have always had also makes it easy to monitor usage. It is impossible to hide a level of consumption that would qualify as abuse, so that doesn't happen. It also helps that most of the output of  companies providing essential services is both produced by, and consumed by, the colonists.

      <summary><h5>The Essential Guarantee</h5></summary>
      <p>Food is the case that is really instructive in this system. About a fifth of the food supply is still imported from Earth and that expense is significant. Those foods also tend to be people's favorites. Locally produced foods that are favored over other foods are also in shorter supply than many would prefer.
      </p>
      <p>Food is allotted to tribes, not individuals. Tribes have their larders, which are stocked by their robots, or carried in by tribe members who have gone personally to select the supply from the greenhouses, gardens, and central stores. These areas are closely monitored by multiple means and there is no way to remove items without it being logged - who, when, what, how much. If a tribe is exceeding its allotment of a food in limited supply, when they leave the storehouse or the greenhouse with it, monitors (in this case actual humans) come and relieve them of it. This happens so rarely and is so easily handled, access to those areas is not restricted. It's just monitored.
      </p>
      <p>Once food is in the possession of tribes, the great self-regulating dynamic of the tribe system looks after the rest. Tribes look after their own, and are responsible for their own. If one of their number is raiding their fridge, it is up to them to sort that out. They may do so however they like (barring violence), but they may not expel someone from their midst. Tribe is like family, it's for life. They have to figure it out. (The tribe system is examined more under Tribe Life, below.)
      </p>
      <p>Food that has been prepared, however, can be charged for. As it comes off a ship or out of a garden, that's free. As it comes on a plate, smelling, looking, and tasting great, that can have a price. Prices rarely apply to one's own tribe. They can, but that only works socially in certain narrow circumstances. People from other tribes? Charge them if you want. Also, people can import food on their own dime and charge for that, prepared or not.
      </p>
      <p>All other commodities and services that are part of the Essential Guarantee are either so easy to provide, or so central to the health of the entire colony, there is no argument about them. Electricity, internet and data services, water, waste processing - the initial infrastructure for these things is expensive, but once built, it lasts a very long time and the maintenance burden is low. Technically, each tribe has an allotment, and use is monitored (because use of everything is monitored, it's just part of the system), but it is so hard to exceed that allotment, it almost never happens. If it does happen, someone goes and checks what the hell they are doing, and usually it is explained to them that it constitutes a business, so either they'll have to stop it, or they'll have to pay for the excess resources they are consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
         Medical services and medicine, public health facilities such as swimming pools, gyms, and sports areas, public transit - providing high quality services of this kind for free is in everyone's best interest. It might be harder to do so well without straining the system, if it wasn't for the robots. With the level of technology the colonies have, it isn't difficult at all to organize everything so these things are both free, and of the finest quality.
      </p>

    <summary><h5>Broadcasting and its Impact</h5></summary>
    <p>From the beginning the colonists have regularly broadcast shows back to Earth. This has always been one of the conditions of being a resident. A bunch of these shows become quite popular on Earth, even during phase 1. There is a range of them, in many languages. Many residents also do extra shows on their own time, usually video blogs.</p>
    <p>That was the plan from the beginning. It goes a long way to maintaining high public support for the program, and is widely recognized as the principal source of a cultural shift around the globe towards an emphasis on science, and a decrease in nationalist sentiment.</p>
    <p>The most popular shows are sports. These sports are unlike anything on Earth, taking full advantage of the low gravity. Once the long dome habitat at the bottom of Cernan's Promise is complete (now referred to as the Trilobite Hab for its shape) an aerial sport is created. The players fly, flapping their wings by pumping their legs, adjusting wing shape with controls in their hands to maneuver. Their movement becomes closely analogous to that of birds. At first they hold aerial races, obstacle courses, and games of tag, later they develop a ball sport with aerial teams.</p>
    <p>Lots of other kinds of shows are popular too. People on Earth see the colonists interacting with each other, expressing themselves, and living their lives, often in detail. Many become pop icons with real influence, especially those from small countries and developing countries. A lot of colonists earn money in their spare time through the shows they produce themselves, appearances they make in other shows (by virtual presence), products marketed on their popularity, endorsements, or artwork and memorabilia they send back to Earth for sale.</p>
    <p>A lot of the money they earn stays on Earth. They use it to back ventures they have an interest in or help out their families. The rest is for having luxuries shipped to them. This mostly involves foods that are in short supply on the Moon (chocolate, cheese, fine liquor and wine, beef, seafood), fine clothing and jewelry, furnishings, and personal electronics. The food, clothing, and goods shipped up by the MA are high quality and include some of all the listed luxuries, plus favorite items for each resident. But more and better is always welcome.</p>
    <p>Fashions from the Moon spread to Earth. Interest in science education is at an all-time high. Belligerent posturing in politics is at an all-time low. This is all thanks to the intimate contact the people of Earth have with the colonists. The fact the program has led to many advances in technology and science supports this dynamic a lot. In particular, it's clear that even with the vast investments made to build the colonies and the transport systems in space, the break-even point is not far away. Everybody loves space now.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><h5>Privatization and The Moon Fund</h5></summary>
    <p>More or less everything that has happened up to this point was anticipated when the Space Settlement Treaty was finalized. It was written into the treaty that once commerce and industry in space reached certain milestones, industry would be privatized, and institutions would be created to facilitate and regulate a market. Towards the end of this phase, that happens.</p>

    <p>Transport, mining, power plants, data transmission, all manufacturing, data collection, farming, and construction are privatized. The entities created are public companies whose shares are traded through the Moon Exchange, which is created for that purpose. Each industry is privatized as a set of companies, not just one, so they are able to compete amongst themselves, and it is feasible for a new company to enter the market. For instance, each power plant becomes its own company, each skyhook, each greenhouse, each factory. The highly integrated and open data infrastructure of the colonies makes this work.
    </p>
    <p>Proceeds from the sale of shares to the public, which is half of all shares, go to the nations of the ISA who built the infrastructure that made it all possible. The other half of shares go to the Moon Fund, including all voting shares. All such shares are non-transferable and receive dividends quarterly.
    </p>
    <p>The shares administered by the Moon Fund belong to several institutions. 10% of the shares, which are 40% of voting shares, belong to the ISA. Their votes are cast by their advisory council and administration. 10% of shares, which are also 40% of voting shares, belong to the Moon Agency. Their votes are cast by the director and the council. 5% of shares, being the remaining 20% of voting shares, belong to the Lunar Research Institute, which oversees all the pure research labs and research facilities on the Moon. Their votes are cast by their own council, whose members are drawn from the universities that are members of the Institute, and their senior staff.
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of this structure is to provide these institutions with the ongoing funds they need to continue to expand our presence in space, and do so in a way that serves everyone's best interests. It creates incentives to provide robust and efficient systems that serve their markets well, respond to those markets, and remain innovative. In essence, instead of a traditional tax structure, the Moon Agency governs the colonies using the 10% of profits of the public companies it receives through the Moon Fund. The ISA has a vested interest in keeping the colonies strong so it realizes more profit for its own operations. The voice of the science community can't be ignored, as they hold the balance of power if the ISA and the Moon Agency are divided, and also they can fund their science projects themselves, instead of needing to go through a government.
    </p>
    <p>The remaining shares belong to the Moon Fund itself. All dividends earned on those shares must be spent on the projects the holders of the voting shares vote for. These projects must be infrastructure in space.
    </p>
    <p>The mega-projects built during the next phase are paid for by the Moon Fund under this program. Just as happened with all the infrastructure on the Moon, it is part of the agreements governing these projects that after designated milestones are reached, being a stated volume of commerce and revenue, these structures are to be privatized. Income from their sale and shares in the new companies shall then be distributed just as they were after the sale of the infrastructure on the Moon. Thus a virtuous cycle is created.
    </p>
    <p>A few key things that are too subject to moral hazard to privatize are administered directly by the Moon Agency, which is a democratic institution. This includes medical services, the justice system (which is tiny), and emergency services (which are almost entirely robotic).
    <p>
      Some of the created companies work almost entirely for the Moon Agency, as mentioned in Local Administration. This is one of many things that makes a local currency necessary.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><h5>Local Virtual Currency and Contracts</h5></summary>
    <p>The colonies are even more saturated with personal computing devices, cloud services, and local networks than the world today. Software for a virtual currency is created and adopted as the standard unit for trade on the colonies. That same software is the basis for forming contracts quickly and easily.
    </p>
    <p>In the same way that accounts holding virtual currency are protected by the very large number of independent, encrypted records of all accounts and transactions, contracts can be quickly drawn up using a broad range of templates and options. Once signed the record is distributed and encrypted just like financial data is. Contracts are in a different database, as they are public records that anyone can read - at least the basic data. Clauses of a contract may be kept private if desired.
