					<h1>Peary Crater: Water Inside, Eternal Sun Outide</h1>
					<p>
						Just a few years ago it was confirmed that in the deep constant
						shadow of the craters of the Moon's poles there is water. Plus a
						mix of other substances that were steamed out of the rest of the
						Moon eons ago - carbon dioxide, ammonia. There seem to be hundreds
						of millions of tons of it, perhaps billions. There ensued excitement
						about the new possibilities for settlement this creates - within a
						small community. Most of the world has already discarded the idea of
						settling the Moon and wants to press on to Mars, if they favor
						space settlement at all. We have fogotten the images of lunar bases
						and towns that were so common during the Apollo days.
					</p>
					<p>
						That small community noted that right beside those reserves of
						volatiles (being substances that normally evaporate away into space on the Moon), there are peaks on the crater
						rims that receive sunlight over 90% of the time. If you can raise
						solar panels on masts 30 m or so, in the right spots they would get
						sunlight virtually all the time. So you have solved energy and water,
						two really big challenges.
						<br><br>
						Thus most pushes for lunar bases these days focus on the poles. There
						is even a business model - turn the water into liquid hydrogen and
						liquid oxygen, and sell it as fuel for raising satellites, deep space missions,
						and space stations. Unlike putting a base on Mars, this is a space
						program we could undertake quickly, it is much safer, and it has
						practical payoffs here at home - space refeuling would allow much
						more space exploration.
						<br><br>
						It has been repeatedly debated whether in this project the base at Peary
						Crater should come first, or the first missions should go
						to Lalande and expand to Peary from there. The use of nuclear ships reduces the advantage of water at hand for fuel, and the early deployment of tethers reduces it even more. The choice of nuclear generators makes solar power unnecessary. The main business models all focus on early establishment of construction ability, and the construction technique did not seem viable at the poles.
					</p>
					<p>
						On further investigation, a version of the construction technique
						planned for Lalande would work with the minerals found in the highlands,
						where the poles are. That means a large
						habitat like proposed for Lalande could be made at Peary, allowing
						the early research and development needed for the core business in this
						paradigm - construction - to be done there. The assertion is that
						construction is the best and fastest way to make a Moon settlement
						profitable, so it is quite significant to have a way to work at the
						pole on the core business, as well as volatile mining.
						In that case, the advantage
						of the machines not needing to deal with night also weighs in favor
						of going there first. So, now the idea is that a small settlement is
						made at Peary, and then the first crew sends machines to Lalande and
						makes the next hab.
						<br><br>
						The early robotic missions would focus on making
						the hab, not on volatile mining. It is much better for people to be
						nearby when undertaking something as tricky as extracting volatiles
						from one of the coldest places in the solar system. Since the focus
						is developing construction capability, the missions can take more
						time to perfect and ramp up production of water,
						carbon dioxide, and ammonia. At first the water that is obtained is
						only to supplement the fuel supply of the nuclear shuttles. Then it
						supplies their fuel entirely, and then the new colony has more and
						more freedom to use water for greenhouses. If there is a good market in cislunar space for water as rocket fuel or whatever else, all the better, but there is no particular need for that in this paradigm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, Peary starts
						shipping water, carbon, and ammonia to Lalande in ever larger
						amounts. That water stays on the Moon, to make ponds, then swimming
						pools, then small lakes. Maybe some would continue to ship to orbit for fuel,
						or radiation shielding. But
						there might be no need. By this time asteroids will be mined for
						water and metals too. They may be a better source for needs in open space.

	An initial model of a permanent polar habitat. This hab is actually easier to	build than the ones at Lalande because the only tension loads that need to be	handled are on the ceiling, and that part will be a membrane shipped from
