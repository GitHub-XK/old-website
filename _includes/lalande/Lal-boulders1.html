      <p>
       Large areas of the central mountains of Lalande are covered in boulders. Each of the 3 big ones at the top is 20 m wide (22 yards). The whole western side of that mountain is blanketed with boulders like this, but the east side has very few by comparison. Why would that be?

      <p>This area is here because it shows how jumbled the results were even though what you see here was all created by the same event, which unfolded very quickly. The asteroid struck with incredible force and threw a huge quantity of material outwards. The material that was thrown straight up, came straight back down again and landed here. How long would that have taken, a few minutes? At the same time, the shockwaves that met here at the crater center caused the ground to be pushed up and created these mountains. The lava produced by the heat of the blast didn't pool here, it was above the line of the melt pool. Since there are jagged broken rocks of different materials, as shown by their different tones, light and dark, the stuff that hit the ground here didn't get mixed, and wasn't coated in the lava that was all over. The chunks just hit, broke apart some more thanks to that, and have sat there pretty much exactly the same ever since, for something like 1.5 billion years. They don't even have much dust on them, or the different tones wouldn't show up.
