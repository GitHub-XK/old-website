								<h3>Ion Drive Cargo Ships</h3>
								<p>
								Ion egines have now been used to take probes to several asteroids.
								NASA's NEXT ion thruster is rated as having an exhaust velocity of
								nearly 40 000 m/s (I<sub>sp</sub> of 4190 s). They burn their fuel
								only a very little at a time, so they are slow to accelerate
								a ship enough to get it somewhere. In this case,
								that makes them good for getting a cargo ship from low Earth orbit to
								lunar orbit. The mass saved because less fuel is needed means a
								much bigger payload can be delivered. Not as much as the difference
								in I<sub>sp</sub> suggests -
								the mass of solar panels needed to power the drives eats
								a little into payload mass, and the slow, spiraling trajectories
								used by low-thrust motors takes a bit more fuel. But several times
								more than chemical rockets could deliver.
								Ion drives are durable, too,
								so the cargo ship could make the run a bunch of times before it
								needed maintenance.

							<p>
								If Neumann drives are successfully developed, that
								would be even better. They look promising if there are no
								issues that show up during on-orbit testing of a working model.
								They might be available
								in a decade or less. Other dark horses include
								Em drives, and Mach drives, but those need a lot more development
								even to be sure they are genuinely viable, and after that a
								lot more development to be working drives.
