				<h2>Nuclear Shuttles</h2>
				<p>
					These were mentioned above in the Power section. The kind
					of nuclear ship that could make a big difference, and wouldn't be
					very hard to produce as we already had a working prototype in the 60s,
					is a ship that would be used only in space, preferably beyond Earth
					orbit. Launching a ship like that presents
					<a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/a/16609/4660">absolutely no radiation
					risk</a>. The fuel is not more radioactive than rocks until you start to burn it, and
					since it is only for use in space, you simply don't turn the engines on until
					you are safely away from Earth. If this was commonly understood half
					a century ago, we'd be living in a completely different world.

					Nuclear thermal ships could attain a specific impulse of 900 to 1000 seconds
					if we rebuilt that 1960s technology. That's a measure of propellant efficiency.
					Another way of saying it is that a nuclear engine could heat its
					fuel so hot it would be moving at 9000 to 10 000 m/s when it exited
					the rocket nozzles. That speed is what determines how hard the
					rocket is pushed in the opposite direction by that exhaust.
					The best chemical rockets have exhaust velocities
					of 4400 m/s in space, so a nuclear engine speeds up or slows
					down a ship twice as fast as the best chemical engines we have.

					The first lunar missions use Lunar Nuclear Craft (LNCs, pronounced 'links') between the lunar surface and lunar orbit. That involves about 4 km/s of delta V for a round trip before the skyhook is set up. Cargo ships coming to lunar orbit can have larger payloads by handing off their cargo to the shuttle and staying in orbit. The LNCs achieve better performance overall by using a <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20170004744&hterms=lantr+nuclear+thermal&qs=N%3D0%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ntx%3Dmode%2Bmatchallany%26Ntt%3Dlantr%2Bnuclear%2Bthermal">LANTR design</a>. They get thrust by superheating hydrogen, and during launch and landing, can greatly augment that thrust by injecting oxygen into the engine nozzle, basically like an afterburner. A recently developed version of this technology is the <a href="http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Space_Engines/AIAA-2004-3863_TRITON.pdf">Triton engine</a> from Pratt & Whitney. It uses a closed Brayton cycle to also use the reactor as a power source. </p>
					<p>
						The LNCs use a cluster of seven such engines to maximize flexibility and reliability. During early missions, when the LNC is landed the entire reactor assembly, including the power generators, has to be dismounted and lowered into a shaft so the neutron and gamma radiation doesn't affect the surrounding base. The structures of the base are nearby, and the LNCs are used for comms, power, power distribution, and even as a simple crane, with their robotic arm. When a LNC prepares for launch, its engine assembly is raised again and remounted. The LNCs are designed for vertical landing and takeoff.
