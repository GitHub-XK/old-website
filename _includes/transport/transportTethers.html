								<h2>Vertical Tethers for the Win</h2>
				<p>
					The real peach is vertical tethers. Think of them as junior
					space elevators. They hang down towards the surface of the body they
					orbit from a large anchor mass, the same as space elevators do. They
					just aren't attached to its surface. The platform at the bottom of
					their cable	(the foot) instead
					moves above the surface at some suitably low altitude. Ships launched
					from the surface need to catch up to the foot, and to brake to return to
					the surface. The advantage is the delta v required is much less than
					what is needed to get to orbit. For the first tether planned for
					the virtual colonies, it takes 1/5 of the normal delta v. That is
					the case if the foot hangs to 100 km above the surface and the
					anchoring asteroid orbits 5000 km up.

				<p>
					Zylon is the material most often considered for this sort of
					application. It is an existing product that is plenty strong
					enough to be the cable for the tether just mentioned. The car that
					runs up and down the cable needs to be designed but that isn't a huge
					challenge. The best cable design, the best way to deploy it, matters
					of control and maintenance and such - these would all need to be
					worked out. They are pretty manageable engineering problems. If
					creation of such a tether was a priority, it is reasonable to expect
					we could have it working in a decade, for the kind of budget needed
					for development of a new rocket.
