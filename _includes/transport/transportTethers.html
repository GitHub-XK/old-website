								<h2>Vertical Tethers for the Win</h2>
				<p>
					The real peach is vertical tethers. Think of them as junior space elevators. They hang down towards the surface of the body they orbit from a large anchor mass, the same as space elevators do. They just aren't attached to its surface. The platform at the bottom of their cable	(the foot) instead moves above the surface at some suitably low altitude. Ships launched from the surface need to catch up to the foot, and to brake to return to the surface. The advantage is the delta v required is much less than what is needed to get to orbit. For the first tether planned for the virtual colonies, it takes 1/5th of the normal delta v. That is the case if the foot hangs to 20 km above the surface and the anchoring asteroid orbits 5000 km up. </p>
        <p>Managing a tether is far easier if you have a nice, heavy anchor mass so big that the center of gravity of the whole complex doesn't move very much as things come and go. That helps its orbit stay nice and circular at the right altitude with much less maintenance. One event such as a shuttle arriving at the foot or a ship being released from the tip can be compensated for enough simply by moving around counterweights, that you can afford to wait for arriving ships to correct the orbit by adding or subtracting momentum, and reduce fuel spent on station-keeping. In fact, you can even slowly alter the orbit of the complex by quickly moving a counterweight car up or down at the right point in orbit. Possibly that could handle station-keeping all by itself. However, tether complexes will always need engines - just to be sure there is always enough thrust around to maintain orbits properly. The 4/5ths of delta V saved this way can still be regarded as coming almost for free. What little thrust the tether's engines need to provide can happen over weeks or months by highly efficient low-thrust motors. HiPEP ion engines would be the best option here, or perhaps Neumann drives, both mentioned 2 sections up. An array of such engines are installed on the tips of the tethers that extend outwards from the anchors (the spaceward tethers). That is where their thrust has the greatest effect, once again reducing the fuel needed, proportional with the engines' distance from the center of the orbited body.</p>

					Zylon is the material most often considered for this sort of application. It is an existing product that is plenty strong enough to be the cable for any of the tethers around the Moon. The car that runs up and down the cable needs to be designed but that isn't a huge challenge. The best cable design, the best way to deploy it, matters of control and maintenance and such - these would all need to be worked out. They are pretty manageable engineering problems. If creation of such a tether was a priority, it is reasonable to expect we could have it working in a decade, for the kind of budget needed for development of a new rocket. </p>
