								<h2>Skyhooks - A Really Big Deal</h2>
								<p>It is the skyhooks that allow ships to move around the solar system using a tiny fraction of the fuel that would otherwise be needed. The skyhooks that greatly reduce the time needed to move between worlds, and extend the launch windows when launches can happen so much, that if the spatial relationship between worlds is really unfavorable some fuel can be burned and they can be reached anyhow, making it possible to launch almost any time. It is Earths's skyhook that turns launching to orbit from here into a job that, compared to rockets today, can be done by a ship both giant and robust that can make the trip thousands of times, without needing to take off with such fury it is like carpet-bombing the launch pad, and it shakes anyone in it to near unconsciousness<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#compareBFR">[?]</sup>. Skyhooks change everything. They are the future, and the sooner we really understand that, the sooner we can move towards that future.

									<span id="compareBFR">Yes, that is really what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdUX3ypDVwI">SpaceX BFR</a> would be like. I mean, things can be done to manage that... nothing cheap or easy... I can't see how the ride would ever be pleasant. The humungous launch complex would need to be like 15 km out to sea. Launches would kill a lot of fish and birds, unless they were thoroughly scared away well before each launch by something they really wouldn't like. The only viable techniques for controlling the gigantic explosion that is the engines firing as designed would be to elevate the launch platform several storeys (so think for a moment about how heavy that rocket is) and channel the flames sideways with a scoop-shaped metal thing under the launch base (the tongue of flame would be hundreds of meters long and have the diameter of a baseball field), or pump basically a ring of waterfalls under it that absorb the life-threatening thunder of it and dissipate some of the heat. Seriously.

									<p>So, please bear with us as we try to explain how they work. It has some wrinkles to it that aren't much of a problem, but need to be explained in order to convincingly state that, really, these things will work and be awesome. If you don't feel the need for such an explanation, you can skip the next section. I suppose not everybody finds rich nerdy enjoyment in something like this. It could be good to read the first 3 paragraphs to get an idea of how they work.

								<h2>How to Think about Vertical Skyhooks</h2>
				<p>
					Think of vertical skyhooks as junior space elevators. They have a tether hanging down towards the surface of the body they orbit from a large anchor mass, the same as space elevators do. They just aren't attached to its surface. The platform at the bottom of their cable	(the foot) instead moves above the surface at some suitably low altitude. Ships launched from the surface need to catch up to the foot, and to brake to return to the surface. The advantage is the delta v required is much less than what is needed to get to orbit. For the first skyhook planned for the virtual colonies, it takes 1/5th of the normal delta v. That is the case if the foot hangs to 20 km above the surface and the anchor mass at the center of gravity orbits 5000 km up. </p>
					<p>The reason why is the speed of the foot is determined by the anchor mass, which is moving at the orbital velocity at its altitude. The pull of gravity decreases as something gets farther from a world, so orbital velocity is slower for it than for something 20 km above the surface. Plus, the foot is always aligned vertically under the anchor mass - it's hanging from it. So, it takes the same amount of time to orbit the Moon once as the anchor mass does, but the distance it covers is far less, because it is travelling along a much smaller circular path. The animation in the sidebar gets this across.
					</p>
					<p>Skyhooks also have a tether extending upwards from the anchor mass deeper into space. The tip of this tether experiences the opposite effect from the foot - it is moving faster than orbital speed at its altitude. The effect is that objects holding onto the tip feel a force pulling outwards, like if you twirled a ball on a string above your head. The amount of that force depends on how much faster they are moving than orbital speed. As things climb the tether from the anchor towards the tip, that force appears and slowly grows. Again the opposite effect is felt climbing from the foot towards the anchor. At the foot, the pull of gravity is almost as much as on the surface. At the anchor, gravity is imperceptible because it is moving at orbital velocity. The closer you are to the anchor as you climb the tether, the closer your velocity is to orbital velocity, and you feel gravity less and less.
					</p>
					<p>So now think about this - as something moves down from the tip, it feels less and less of a force pulling up, and as something moves up from the foot, it feels less and less of a force pulling down. Where does that energy go? Energy doesn't just disappear, any more than mass does. The motion of the whole skyhook changes so the energy remains the same. When a car climbs to the anchor, as it feels less downward pull, a pull to the side is experienced by the tether. That pull is in the direction opposite its orbital motion around the Moon (which is called the retrograde direction, and the direction of orbit is called prograde). That's because the car started out moving much more slowly prograde, when it was at the foot. So, the tether is dragging it prograde as the tether's prograde speed increases. The end result is that the anchor mass experiences a net pull retrograde, which slows it down. The amount it is slowed down depends on how much more it masses than the car does.</p>
        <p>Managing a skyhook is far easier if you have a nice, heavy anchor mass so big that the momentum it has dwarfs the momentum changes caused by cars moving up and down the tethers.
				The nice circular orbit it needs to have then moves very little as cars ferry things along the tethers. The feet of the skyhooks in the lunar constellation travel only 20 km above the surface, and there is 5000 km between them and the anchor station. If the anchor mass slows by only a few meters per second, in a few hours the foot platform will slam into the ground and be destroyed. If the situation is not quickly corrected the whole skyhook could be dragged down and crash.</p>
				<p>The anchor of a skyhook must have engines on it (or even better, the skyhook tip must have engines) to speed up the anchor to compensate for the cars slowing it down (or speeding it up, as happens when a car descends from the skyhook's tip - that's a problem too). But, there are other ways to manage a skyhook's momentum budget that use no fuel at all. The first step is to try to balance incoming and outgoing payloads.
				</p>
				<p>Just as a car climbing from the foot to the anchor slows the skyhook down, a car descending from the tip to the anchor speeds it up. And each of these processes in reverse does the opposite thing - when a car goes from the anchor to the foot, or the anchor to the tip. So, the best time to have a car descending from the tip, is when there is a car climbing from the foot, and that way they balance each other out.
				</p>
				<p>The ships coming in from other worlds are far larger than the shuttles coming to the foot platform. So, to keep things balanced, you need to ferry the cargo on the interplanetary ship downwards bit by bit, while many shuttles bring cargo to the foot and bit by bit that gets ferried up. With the really huge ships at the end of the timeline, it could take weeks to complete this operation. It takes so long, it's best to slowly ferry the whole interplanetary ship down to the anchor mass, even as it is also being unloaded, so that other ships will be able to dock with the tip or launch from it sooner.
				</p>
				<p>This reduces a lot the need to use rocket engines to correct the skyhooks' orbits, but it won't do it all. There are lots of reasons why the traffic won't always balance in a timely manner. Also, in Phase 4 of the timeline the skyhooks are turned into specialized pairs of skyhooks, one the launch skyhook that mostly handles interplanetary ships, and the other the surface skyhook that mostly handles traffic to and from the surface. Loads can still be balanced as the cargo moves between the two skyhooks in each of these pairs on ships called hoppers, but it adds another layer of complexity to the job. It is a good thing that the cars on the tethers and the hoppers are completely robotic and take direction only from the anchor's navigation computers, short of some human override. Those computers constantly monitor orbit closely and calculate when and where all the cars and hoppers need to be based on that, and the schedule of ships arriving and departing.
				</p>
				<p>Those computers have other tricks up their sleeves when all this orchestration isn't enough. If there isn't a ship or a car in a good place to move in some way to balance things, then a simple rock will do. Sometimes a really big rock, massing a bunch of tons, sometimes a bunch of small ones that mass only a ton or so each. A suitable supply is stored on the anchor masses of the skyhooks, which have to be as heavy as possible anyhow, and don't have a direct effect on the loads being borne by the tethers themselves, as they are at orbital altitude and aren't being pulled in any direction by the forces we're talking about. </p>
				<p>The rocks do need to be ferried by cars to where they do their work, but at least there doesn't need to be any actual payload with a destination involved. And they don't need to move all the way to the tip or the foot - that would complicate traffic of actual goods and be much slower. They are just ferried up or down by about a fifth of the length of a given tether (which can mean up to 7000 km on the longest tether), and then released. A rock released from below the anchor has been pulling the tether prograde as it descends, causing a small net increase in the orbital speed of its skyhook. At the altitude it is released, it enters an orbit around the skyhook's world. That orbit will be an ellipse that comes closest the world on the opposite side of where it was released. As it gets closer, it speeds up, and as it gets farther away, it slows down. Eventually it comes back to the point at which it was released, and can be easily captured. It will come back with the same speed at which it was released, which is to say, no speed relative to the skyhook tether at that point, and it will brush by it nice and close. If it isn't convenient to grab it at that moment, it will continue to return like that, and it can be caught on another pass<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#releaseCatch">[?]</sup>. Then it is ferried back to the anchor to be reused another time. The same effect happens when a rock is released from above the anchor station, except that makes the skyhook slow down.
				</p>
				<div class="tooltip_templates">
					<span id="releaseCatch">What this would look like from the perspective of the skyhook, is that the rock first drops downwards, because it isn't going fast enough for orbit where it is. As it drops it gains speed. Long before it hits the ground, it has acquired orbital speed. To the skyhook, it is moving faster than the tether at its altitude, and it pulls out in front of it. It is moving fastest when the skyhook and it are directly opposite the point where the rock was dropped, on the other side of the world. After that, its orbital path rises again, until it is once again at the altitude it was originally released from. As it rises, it also slows, this is a characteristic of orbits known as Kepler's Second Law. As it slows, the tether catches up to it, and to the tether, it is approaching it again. The path it takes is a loop, to observers on the skyhook. <br><br>
						As there could definitely be reason to release lots of these rocks, and often to be in no hurry to recover them again, there would be a small sort of swarm of them accompanying the skyhook, gently looping around and almost kissing the tether each time they pass by it. Sometimes they would be hundreds or thousands of kilometers away, sometimes they would be very, very close. So that means they are navigation hazards. They should have solar panels mounted on them sufficient to power beacons that emit both light and a radio signal. So, what this would be like is that the skyhook is accompanied by fireflies that swoop around in loops in front of it, below the anchor station, and others that swoop around in loops behind it, above the anchor station. Pretty. : D

					Zylon is the material most often considered for this sort of application. It is an existing product that is plenty strong enough to be the cable for any of the skyhooks around the Moon.  </p>
