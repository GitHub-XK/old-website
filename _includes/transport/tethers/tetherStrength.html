      <h3>Tether Cable Strength</h3>
      <p>The most promising materials for early skyhooks in lunar orbit are aramid (Technora or Kevlar) and PBO (Zylon). Thorough tests of the behaviour of the material under load in orbit would need to be done before construction of the first skyhook and would necessarily take a few years. That could be done at the new space station built for the Moon settlement program. Without those tests, it's necessary to estimate some important qualities of the two materials. Actual properties may show the mass and complexity of the skyhooks will need to be greater, or less. The main point, though, is that skyhooks for the Moon can be built of either material. No new material needs to be invented.
      </p>
      <p>Zylon, the strongest of these materials, has an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 5.8 GPa. That means it can support a maximum of 5800 Newtons of force for each square millimeter of its cross-sectional area. A thread with a thickness similar to a sewing needle can support 590 kg, or about 8 adults (on Earth). However, loading a material like that weakens it. It stretches under the strain and will break in short order. Testing of how cables of these materials slowly stretch until they break shows that as the fraction of a cable's UTS being supported diminishes, the time it can sustain that load before failure lengthens on a log scale. Toyobo, the manufacturer of Zylon, tested a series of cables until they broke, and found that a cable loaded with 85% of its UTS will fail in only a minute, while one loaded with 60% of its UTS will take approximately 8 years to fail (based on extrapolation). Considering this result, and all the other factors the skyhook cables will be subjected to, a safety factor of 3 is used for the lunar skyhooks. That is the same as saying they are never loaded beyond one third of their UTS. Fortunately, Zylon is strong enough that even this exponential relationship doesn't cause the mass of the cables to balloon too much in the mild gravity field of the Moon. With a safety factor of 3, meaning the cables never bear more than a third of their UTS, the cable for the whole skyhook only needs to mass about 20 times what the total payload will mass <sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#taperCalc">[?]</sup>.

      <div class="tooltip_templates">
        <span id="taperCalc">The calculation for this has to consider the changing force of gravity and angular momentum at all points on a cable, as well as the tensile strength and density of the cable material and the exponential growth of its cross-sectional area as it gets further from its end point. The safety factor multiplies the exponent in this situation. The complexity of the calculation means the results found on the <a href="https://www.moonwards.com/teth.html">Tether Tool page</a> are only a good approximation, that is a bit on the heavy side.

        <summary><h5 style="display: inline">More about Cable Loading</h5></summary>
      <p>A study done through Cambridge University, <a href="http://www-civ.eng.cam.ac.uk/cjb/papers/p79pre.pdf">Creep and Strength Retention of Aramid Fibres</a>, did a series of tests on both Technora and Kevlar for up to a year. Those tests showed that even though both Kevlar and Technora have formulas in the aramid family, Kevlar's ability to bear a load falls off sharply after a year, while Technora seems able to continue to bear a load that is 70% of its UTS for a century. Clearly extrapolation was also involved here, but the result is still promising. If nothing else, it shows that slight adjustments to formula and manufacturing technique can make a big difference to such properties in materials of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>Since most of the mass of a skyhook's cables is there to support the cable itself, for most of its length, it can be considered to have something close to a constant static load. The cables slowly narrow as they get farther from the anchor mass because at the top, they need to support all the mass of all the cable below, and also the payload, while at the foot and the tip, they are only supporting the payload (which here means a fully loaded shuttle, the platform where it docks, and the climber car its cargo is loaded onto). Between the foot and the anchor, the way the cable hanging below a point keeps getting heavier the further from the foot it is, means the cable needed to carry that mass increases in an exponential relationship.
      </p>
    </details>
      <p>A safety factor that high is necessary due to the other factors acting on the cables besides the loads they are bearing. Both Zylon and aramids break down quickly in sunlight, so they will need to be protected by a sheath that blocks out the light. That sheath will also need to keep their temperature in a comfortable range by transmitting only a small portion of the heat of the sun to them, while preventing most of the heat of the cables from escaping. It also forms a protective layer, reducing wear on the cables from deformation and friction when cars pass by, pressing the cables between their wheels.
      </p>
      <p>Micrometeoroid strikes should be quite rare, but the cables need to be able to sustain them without risk to the skyhooks. The cables will be an open mesh weave that redistributes loads around any broken ropes in the weave. This weave was designed by Robert Hoyt at Tethers Unlimited. New ropes can be woven into the mesh by maintenance cars. Individual sections of mesh can be only a few hundred meters long, their ends looping through the ends of the mesh sections above and below at reinforced points. The mesh system also allows entire cable to be slowly replaced over time, rope by rope, section by section, until none of it is the original material.

      <h3>Future Cable Materials</h3>
      <p>Carbon nanotube (CNT) cable remains far in the future. Advances towards that goal remain slow. Developing a large amount of infrastructure in space is itself likely to speed the pace of progress on this. CNTs are one of the materials that can be created by vapor deposition on a carefully prepared substrate. Performing such work in the hard vacuum and microgravity of orbit is likely to permit approaches that yield larger quantities and superior quality. It's also easier to create and sustain higher processing temperatures in space. Temperature control can be energy intensive but quite precise and repeatable too. Different levels of gravity can be imitated on different levels of the rotating sections of the space station. All of these factors create opportunities for new approaches to materials production.
      </p>
      <p>
      The timeline doesn't make use of CNTs until 35 years after it starts. At that date, a skyhook for Earth is built using cable with tensile strength of 30 GPa. This is a reasonable estimation of the strength the first such cables could have. A material like that produced on industrial scales permits skyhooks to be built from Mercury to Titan.
      </p>
      <p>Research into polymers and carbon materials may lead to unexpected finds that provide new solutions, too. Such a possibility is <a href="http://imechanica.org/files/PRL10114550108Yuntian.pdf">colossal carbon tubes (CCT)</a>, discovered through a collaboration among several research institutes and universities in China and America in 2008. They are made purely of a hexagonal mesh of carbon atoms, just like CNTs and graphene, but are double-walled tubes around 50 micrometers wide (which is colossal compared to CNTs) and have already been produced in lengths of several centimeters (which is enough to spin them into thread). Oddly, aside from that initial paper, nothing has been published about them. They display great promise if they could be produced in bulk. Their strength isn't that much higher than Zylon (UTS of 6.9 GPa) but they are extraordinarily light (about 0.12 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). As most of the mass of a tether is cable that is just there to support the mass of the cable itself, that makes a tremendous difference. If a way could be found to bind the CCT fibers together strongly enough, they could potentially outperform the carbon nanotube cable posited above.
