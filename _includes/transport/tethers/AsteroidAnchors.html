				<h3>Asteroid Anchors</h3>
				<p>The first skyhook built in lunar orbit gets its anchor mass from material slowly lifted from the surface over many trips. More payload will be heading down the tethers to the surface than will be heading from the surface to go back to Earth. Ships arrive from Earth infrequently enough that the time necessary to balance loads is available. Still, to allow the anchor to be built up as quickly as possible, it is worth putting a large set of high-efficiency engines at the skyhook tip (most likely VASIMR or Neumann drives) and running them pretty much all the time, so whenever they are free the shuttles can bring loads of regolith to the foot, which get ferried up and added to the anchor.
				</p>
				<p>Once asteroids are being brought into lunar orbit for study and then for mining, their mass is added to the anchors and that increases anchor mass much more quickly. After the first two skyhooks, most of them get their anchor mass entirely from asteroid material. In the Earth-Moon system, asteroid mining, skyhook development, and space settlement all benefit each other.
				</p>
				<p>The skyhook's orbits are made far more stable by the addition of asteroids to their anchor masses. The presence of skyhooks allows machinery to be delivered to them, and products to be shipped from them, for a fraction of the fuel normally required. The ships that go retrieve the asteroids can be in the ideal place to launch fast and at high speed when new targets are detected, and such detection is aided by placing telescopes devoted to the search on skyhook tips. Teleoperation of equipment proceeds more efficiently because the skyhooks allow the colonies to be home to lots of people, meaning operators have to deal with only a very brief signal delay because they are close by - some are actually on stations built into the anchors. Industry in space is aided by how the skyhooks make the price of shipping high volumes of material between the surface and orbit. So, materials more easily obtained and refined on the Moon, like aluminum and titanium, can be obtained there, and materials better acquired from asteroids, like carbon, can be obtained from them.
