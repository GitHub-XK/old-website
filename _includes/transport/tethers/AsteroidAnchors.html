				<h3>Asteroid Anchors</h3>
				<p>The first skyhook built in lunar orbit gets its anchor mass from material slowly lifted from the surface over many trips. More payload will be heading down the tether to the surface than will be heading from the surface to go back to Earth, so there is room in the mass budget to send mass for the anchor up the tether. Ships arrive from Earth infrequently enough that the time necessary to move loads in a balanced manner is available. Still, to allow the anchor to be built up as quickly as possible, it is worth putting a large set of high-efficiency engines at the skyhook tip (most likely VASIMR or Neumann drives) and running them pretty much all the time, so whenever they are free the shuttles can bring loads of regolith to the foot, which get ferried up and added to the anchor.
				</p>
				<p>Once asteroids are being brought into lunar orbit for study and then for mining, their mass is added to the anchors and that increases anchor mass much more quickly. After the first two skyhooks, most get their anchor mass entirely from asteroid material. In the Earth-Moon system, asteroid mining, skyhook development, and space settlement all benefit each other.
				</p>
				<p>The skyhook's orbits are made far more stable by the addition of mass from asteroids to their anchors. The presence of skyhooks allows delivery of machinery to turn the asteroid material into products for a fraction of the fuel otherwise required. The ships that go retrieve the asteroids can be in the ideal place to be quickly launched at high speed when new targets are detected, using almost no fuel. Such detection is aided by placing telescopes devoted to the search on skyhook tips. Teleoperation of equipment proceeds more efficiently because the skyhooks allow the colonies to be home to lots of people, meaning operators have to deal with only a very brief signal delay because they are close by - some are actually on stations built into the anchors. Industry in space is aided by how the skyhooks lower the price of shipping high volumes of material. This especially aids the Moon. Materials more easily obtained and refined on the Moon, like aluminum and titanium, can be obtained there, and materials better acquired from asteroids, like carbon, can be obtained from them.
