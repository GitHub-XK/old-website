      <p>In the rows that show tether mass, this is the mass of just the CNT cable. Those numbers show the mass first in metric kilotons, and then in the brackets, as what multiple it is of the payload mass. Really the payload mass should be multiplied by 1.05 to account for the mass of the climber, the foot platform, and all the infrastructure on the tether for maintenance and power transmission. It also doesn't count the mass of the shaft that joins the two tethers together, around which the anchor mass is built up. That probably adds another 1% or so to the total cable mass. These things aren't included for the sake of simplicity. The grand total of both skyhooks also includes the mass of the foot station on the launch skyhook. As that mass directly bears on the mass of the cables and the strain on them, it is included there. Anchor mass uninvolved with bearing the weight on the cables has little relevance to the overall structure, other than it affects the center of gravity of the whole thing. It goes up and down over time, mostly up, and adds stability in general as it grows. </p>
      <p>Tether figures use a safety factor of 2. That factor accounts for what a tether needs to operate safely even despite wear and tear, manufacturing defects, and damage due to any micrometeoroid strikes. Early skyhooks made of Zylon need a safety factor of 3, but because CNTs are much stiffer, can handle a wider range of temperatures, and don't degrade in sunlight, SF of 2 is enough. It means these cables never bear more than 50% of the maximum load they could theoretically sustain according to their ultimate tensile strength.</p>
      <p> All skyhooks are made of an open weave of cables known as a <a href="http://www.tethers.com/Hoytether.html"> 'Hoytether'</a> weave, after Robert Hoyt of Tethers Unlimited. That design makes it easy for maintenance carts to weave in new cables when they detect a weakness on a cable. This may mean that a safety factor somewhat less than 2 would be fine. Because tethers must taper so the top of the tether can sustain the mass of all the cable below it, a change in safety factor affects the total mass of a tether in an exponential relationship. Being able to safely reduce the safety factor can drastically reduce the mass of cable that must be fabricated and delivered to build a skyhook. Thus bear in mind that as in all things here, this number is estimated somewhat on the conservative side. </p>

<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="polar-equator">
  The Mercury colony will be at the north pole, so the surface skyhook has a polar orbit. The launch skyhook needs to have an orbit inclined 7&deg; from the equator or it is rarely aligned for launches to other planets. So, ships coming and going are all going to have to deal with an 83&deg; plane changes when moving between skyhooks. Being able to do the plane change between two upper tethers should reduce the fuel needed compared to plane changes without that assistance.
</span>
</div>
<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="payloadDemand">
  Because the surface skyhook has a polar orbit, it can't be used to handle launch of Chukwas. The launch skyhook has to do it all. It has to be able to bear 100 kt at its tip.
</span>
</div>
<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="skyhookMass">
  A skyhook that combined the tasks of launch and surface ops, and had similar capacity to the skyhook pair shown here, would need to mass about 1008 kt, making it 145 kt heavier than the two skyhooks. Even then, its lower tether would only be able to support 3 kt, while the lower tether of the launch skyhook can bear 10 kt, albeit its foot is moving much faster and likely there are few cases where it makes sense to use that tether. Not only does a skyhook pair take less material, a spacecraft going up from the anchor station to launch from the launch skyhook only needs to travel half as far. There are twice as many berths, and 8 times as many launch opportunities. It might be a bit tricky to hop from the surface skyhook to the launch skyhook and vice versa, and it takes a little fuel. Overall though, a big plus to have skyhook pairs instead of one that does it all.
</span>
</div>
<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="footSpeed">
  The Earth spins at a velocity of about 450 m/s at the equator, so a launcher would only have to gain speed of 2.35 km/s to reach the foot platform.
</span>
</div>
<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="phobosFoot">
  Actually, the average distance of this foot is 192 km, and at apoapsis it is 334 km. Which is a pain, but worth it. This is because its anchor is Phobos. See note below.
</span>
</div>
<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="phobosAnchor">
  The anchor in this case is actually the moon Phobos, which orbits at an average distance of 5980 km from the equator of Mars. But its orbit is rather eccentric, so sometimes it is as close as 5838 km. This is why the foot of these skyhooks can only come down to 50 km, even though since Mars has such a thin atmosphere, and Phobos is such a giant reservoir of momentum there is no need to think about performing orbital corrections to compensate for drag. In fact, the orbit of the launch skyhook will be matched in eccentricity, to make it easier to keep them far apart with little orbital maintenance. However, as the orbit of Phobos is inclined 26&deg; to the ecliptic, a plane change of 26&deg; will be needed to hop to the launch skyhook, as it is best for it to be aligned to the ecliptic to minimize the energy spacecraft launched from it need for plane changes.
</span>
</div>
<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="titanFoot">
  Titan's atmosphere is so dense (1.45 times Earth's at its surface), and its gravity so low (0.14 g, similar to the Moon), that it extends to a great height. Even at this altitude, the foot platform will experience measurable drag that will occasionally need to be corrected for. Vehicles from the surface headed for the foot platform will be able to use lift to get most of the way and require little fuel to cover the remaining distance.
</span>
</div>
<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="footStation">
  To place the center of gravity of the launch skyhooks where it needs to be - at the anchor station - the most mass efficient method is to add mass at the foot. If this isn't done, the much greater mass of the upper tether puts the center of gravity inside that tether. A very heavy anchor station goes a long way to fixing this issue, but it isn't enough, and at any rate a solution is needed while that anchor mass is being accumulated. Making a cable capable of sustaining the heavy mass of a large foot station is cheap, it takes only a fraction of a ton for each ton of payload. And then a great facility can be created at the foot, that takes advantage of the proximity to the surface for a great view and reduced radiation shielding needs.<br><br>
  The figures in this row show a rough estimate of how massive the foot station would need to be to place the center of gravity between the upper and lower tethers. The analysis needed to properly estimate this is far beyond my math abilities and will need to wait for a time when someone else can give the question the attention it needs. A precise solution for this is impossible due to the nature of the calculation. Experimentation with an actual system will be necessary to derive a functional formula that gives a really good approximate solution (but not an exact one).
</span>

<div class="tooltip_templates">
<span id="Merc-SS-Vinf">
  This isn't enough to get to any other world. It's about 2/3 what's needed to get to Venus, but would rarely be used for that, as this skyhook is in a polar orbit. Venus would rarely be properly aligned with it for a good trajectory to result from a launch from this skyhook. (Mercury's orbit is quite eccentric for a planet, and when it is at aphelion it would be able to launch to much closer to the orbit of Venus, but Venus is unlikely to be there when that ship arrives.) This upper tether exists to assist with transfers between skyhooks, and to give the sailing ships an initial boost.
