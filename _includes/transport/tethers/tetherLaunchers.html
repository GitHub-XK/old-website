				<h3>Tethers as Launchers</h3>
				<p>
					Extend tethers outwards from the anchors, heading
					away from the lunar surface, and they become launchers. That's because the
					foot and the tip of the tether orbit the Moon at the speed of the
					asteroid at the center of gravity, and not at the natural orbital
					speed for an object at their altitude. The foot moves far slower
					than orbital speed, and the tip moves much faster. If the
					tether's spaceward cable is 15,000 km long, terminating at an
					altitude of 20,000 km, the outward velocity it imparts to a vessel
					released from there is 2.7 km/s. That's more than enough to return
					to Earth, or go to Mars, Vesta, Ceres, or Venus. It will get you most
					of the way to Jupiter.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you manage to balance the mass
					that leaves the tethers with the mass that is received by them, you
					can even do all this without any use of fuel. The momentum the
					tether complex loses when something leaves is balanced by the
					momentum gained when something arrives. In practice, though, a bunch
					of engines on the anchor masses are needed to keep
					orbits nice and circular and in the right spot. A few small engines would be enough to achieve this,
					since the asteroid anchor is many times heavier than any ship, and
					the center of gravity of the whole tether can be moved at will by
					reeling the spaceward and moonward tethers in and out. Making the
					platforms at the tip and foot of the tether complex good and
					massive helps with this, and also reduces oscillations by
					increasing the tension on the cables.
