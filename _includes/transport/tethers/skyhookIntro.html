<h2>Skyhooks - A Really Big Deal</h2>
<p>It is the skyhooks that allow ships to move around the solar system using a tiny fraction of the fuel that would otherwise be needed. The skyhooks that greatly reduce the time needed to move between worlds, and extend the launch windows when launches can happen so much, that if the spatial relationship between worlds is really unfavorable some fuel can be burned and they can be reached anyhow, making it possible to launch almost any time. The Earths's skyhook turns launching to orbit from here into a job that, compared to rockets today, can be done by a ship both giant and robust that can make the trip thousands of times, without needing to take off with such fury it is like carpet-bombing the launch pad, and shaking anyone in it to near unconsciousness<sup class="note tooltip" data-tooltip-content="#compareBFR">[?]</sup>. The Moon's skyhooks allow shuttles to move between any two points on its surface for about a quarter of the fuel otherwise needed. Each of the worlds where skyhooks are built receive this same benefit. Skyhooks change everything. They are the future, and the sooner we really understand that, the sooner we can move towards that future.

  <span id="compareBFR">Yes, that is really what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdUX3ypDVwI">SpaceX BFR</a> would be like. I mean, things can be done to manage that... nothing cheap or easy... I can't see how the ride would ever be pleasant. The humungous launch complex would need to be like 15 km out to sea. Launches would kill a lot of fish and birds, unless they were thoroughly scared away well before each launch by something they really wouldn't like. The only viable techniques for controlling the gigantic explosion that is the engines firing as designed would be to elevate the launch platform several storeys (so think for a moment about how heavy that rocket is) and channel the flames sideways with a scoop-shaped metal thing under the launch base (the tongue of flame would be hundreds of meters long and have the diameter of a baseball field), or pump basically a ring of waterfalls under it that absorb the life-threatening thunder of it and dissipate some of the heat. Seriously.

<p>The sort of skyhooks we are talking about here are vertical skyhooks. Think of them as junior space elevators. They have a lower tether hanging down towards the surface of the body they orbit from a large anchor mass, the same as space elevators do. They just aren't attached to its surface. The platform at the bottom of their cable	(the foot) instead moves above the surface at some suitably low altitude. Ships launched from the surface need to catch up to the foot, and to brake to return to the surface. The advantage is the delta v required is much less than what is needed to get to orbit, because the foot is moving much slower than orbital speed. For the first skyhook planned for the virtual colonies, it takes 1/5th of the normal delta v. That is the case if the foot hangs to 20 km above the surface and the anchor mass at the center of gravity orbits 5000 km up.
</p>
<p>Skyhooks also have an upper tether extending upwards from the anchor mass deeper into space. The tip of this tether experiences the opposite effect from the foot - it is moving faster than orbital speed at its altitude. The effect is that objects holding onto the tip feel a force pulling outwards, like if you twirled a ball on a string above your head. The amount of that force depends on how much faster they are moving than orbital speed. As things climb the tether from the anchor towards the tip, that force appears and slowly grows. Again the opposite effect is felt climbing from the foot towards the anchor. At the foot, the pull of gravity is almost as much as on the surface. At the anchor, gravity is imperceptible because it is moving at orbital velocity. The closer you are to the anchor as you climb the tether, the closer your velocity is to orbital velocity, and you feel gravity less and less.
</p>
<p>Essentially there are two things that have to be managed for skyhooks to work - angular momentum and cable strength. Angular momentum is how fast a skyhook is moving in its orbit. As payloads arrive and move along the tethers, the momentum of the whole skyhook is changed. It will slow down, which will cause its orbit to drop, or it will speed up, causing its orbit to rise.</p>
<p>There are several options for correcting this, explained in the expanding section below. It's pretty detailed. The short version is that to minimize the amount of fuel engines on the anchor and at the tip of the skyhook use, payloads travelling down the tethers need to be balanced by payloads travelling up them. When this isn't enough, dummy masses can be moved up or down from the anchor and released such that they enter elliptical orbits that accompany the skyhook. Later they can be retrieved and returned to the anchor. Both activities will affect the skyhook's angular momentum and can be carried out when convenient. The essential thing is to increase the mass of the anchor over time until it is thousands of times as massive as any payload that moves along the tethers. Then its angular momentum is affected so little by those movements that it takes a long time for changes to accumulate to the point where it affects operations. Thus there is lots of time to make changes with passive techniques instead of using engines.
