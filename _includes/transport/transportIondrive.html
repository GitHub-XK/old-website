								<h3>Potential Future Engine Options</h3>
								<p>
								Ion egines have now been used to take probes to several asteroids. NASA's NEXT ion thruster is rated as having an exhaust velocity of nearly 40 000 m/s (I<sub>sp</sub> of 4190 s). They burn their fuel only a very little at a time, limited by electrical power. They are therefore slow to accelerate a ship enough to get it somewhere. That could make them good for getting a cargo ship from low Earth orbit to lunar orbit. The mass saved because less fuel is needed means a much bigger payload can be delivered. Not as much as the difference in I<sub>sp</sub> suggests - the mass of solar panels needed to power the drives eats a little into payload mass, and the slow, spiraling trajectories used by low-thrust motors takes a bit more fuel. But the payload is still several times more than chemical rockets, or even nuclear, could deliver. Ion drives are durable, too, so the cargo ship could make the run a bunch of times before it needed maintenance. </p>

        However, it would take about 6 months for the cargo ship to reach the Moon from Earth orbit, and that could be a damaging bottleneck for the overall project. The early missions are primarily to test prototype robots. Once that test data from the lunar surface is in, engineering teams would have about 2 months before the ship is back and ready for a new payload. (The return trip is faster because it takes less delta V to break orbit, and the ship is much lighter.) Then the engineering teams would have to wait a further 6 months for the new versions to be tested, and again have 2 months to redesign the prototypes and build them so they are ready when the ship gets back. The engineers would either be sitting on their hands or racing to complete new iterations. Since there will be at least one crewed mission in support of all that testing, which couldn't possibly spend six months getting to the Moon, there will also necessarily be at least one large mission using conventional hydrolox (burning hydrogen and oxygen) upper stage engines. So, the cargo ship might as well have next-generation hydrolox engines. After the first tether orbiting the Moon is complete, there would be no further role for an ion-drive ship on the Earth-Moon run, anyway. A cargo ship with hydrolox engines will need maintenance in orbit earlier, but a space station in support of these missions is needed for lots of other reasons too, so that is no issue.

        For launching from the Moon to deep space destinations like Mars or Venus, low-thrust ion drives could be a good choice. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEXT_(ion_thruster)">NEXT</a> ion drives require a tenth of the fuel of hydrolox engines for the same delta v, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Power_Electric_Propulsion">HiPEP ion drive</a> about a fifteenth (that one is still in development though). <a href="http://neumannspace.com/blog/fuel-of-the-week-magnesium/">Neumann drives</a> would be even better if they are successfully developed. They look promising as long as no issues show up during on-orbit testing of a working model, which should happen in 2018 on board the ISS. They might be available in a decade or less. They could be fueled with magnesium sourced from the Moon, or aluminum collected from scrapped satellites and spent upper stages, or even carbon from the waste produced by a human crew. </p>
				<p>The new engine design that is closest to being a commercial product is the VASIMR drive. 

				<p>Dark horses include Em drives, and Mach drives, but there is much controversy over whether those engines work at all, or the apparent thrust in small tests of the principal are reading artifacts of the experiments as real thrust.</p>
