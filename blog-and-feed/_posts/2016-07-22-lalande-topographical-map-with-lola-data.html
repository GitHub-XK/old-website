(Note: the following is one of various posts that were copied here from the <a href="http://moonwards.com/">Moonwards.com</a> forum for the sake of preserving the early days of the project. It was originally posted there on Dec 14th, 2015.)  <br /><br />Prof. Brian Lynch of Queens University was kind enough to render a 3D model of Lalande Crater and the surrounding area for me, in two versions, with and without a WAC image from LROC laid overtop. <br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CDDs3wfl_2g/V5KPJ_6RAQI/AAAAAAAAWIk/ByfG5VUoHx0dWJKLaTys8Cxg4CIO29_jgCK4B/s1600/20151214003837566e0f8dc9a6c.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="205" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CDDs3wfl_2g/V5KPJ_6RAQI/AAAAAAAAWIk/ByfG5VUoHx0dWJKLaTys8Cxg4CIO29_jgCK4B/s400/20151214003837566e0f8dc9a6c.jpg" width="400" /></a><br /><br />I am busy enough setting up other things that i haven't settled down to working with this excellent base and using LROC imagery to correct artifacts in the LOLA data, something that i hope will be a nice calm activity for quiet January days... maybe February... <br /><br />I was thrilled to get this. A few other people have been helping out too. One of the many things i'm trying to figure out is how to best thank them by crediting them in the most prominent and interesting way on the site. This is one of the important things to making a collaborative project on a small budget work. Any suggestions welcome...
