The dust roaster hasn't been labelled. It is an important piece.
It takes a molten regolith feed and super-heats it by induction, then passes
that through an electric field that causes different ions to deflect by
different amounts. You get a set of pure metals in the collector, neatly
separated. And you can also skim off pure oxygen during the process. This one
machine solves several problems. Even the slag is useful.
