				<h1>Power Infrastructure</h1>
				<p>
					Unless you go back to plans from the 70s, reference to
					nuclear power has completely disappeared from proposals
					for the Moon. This is unfortunate, as nuclear power is
					constant day and night, small modular plants are extremely
					simple to deploy, and safety is quite easy. At the poles,
					sunlight is nearly constant on certain mountain peaks,
					making solar power a good alternative to nuclear.
					Anywhere else,
					to set up a settlement you need nuclear power. Nuclear is
					a really good idea on the Moon. Here, it is used while
					the initial colony at Lalande, Cernan's Promise, gets
					going.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later on, once Cernan's Promise has developed the
					infrastructure, it can start extracting thorium from
					minerals in and around the crater and produce nuclear
					fuel on-site instead of importing it from Earth. But
					that wouldn't really be for power plants - it would be
					for nuclear rockets. Unless technology like Mach drives
					manages to produce high-thrust engines based on completely
					new science, nuclear engines will continue to be the
					best transport option between the surface of a celestial
					body and orbit. (Unless you've managed to build a space
					elevator... and not if the body has an atmosphere and
					someone lives there... there are a few wrinkles.)
				</p>
				<h3>Solar Thermal Turbines</h3>
				<p>
					The main power source once Lalande has a genuine town,
					and later for the city, isn't nuclear or solar panels.
					It's turbines running on stored solar heat. Specifically,
					closed Brayton cycle turbines using a gaseos working fluid,
 					heated by a mass of molten
					regolith, which in turn is heated by tubes filled with
					molten salts that circulate through a trough of
					parabolic mirrors. These are being called the Thermal
					Energy Storage Systems - the TESS.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reservoirs of molten regolith these systems produce
					are useful. Important volatiles such as
					oxides of potassium, phosphate, and sodium boil off
					them and are collected. If operated
					at a high enough temperature, vapors of pure oxygen
					could also be collected. The systems are sized to have extra
					capacity so that some of the lava produced can be drawn
					off for use elsewhere - such as to supply the dust roasters,
					or as pre-processed feedstock for reactors making glass. The
					heat reservoir would thus need to be resupplied with fresh
					regolith as its contents are drawn off or boil off. Any
					regolith will do, so it can function as a giant cauldron
					contantly stewing a regolith soup. By adjusting the
					minerology of the ingredients and how long the contents are
					left to boil, the chemistry of the lava can be tuned to best
					serve the needs of the furnaces and reactors
					that later use it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the components for TESS units are simple and can
					be produced on-site early in colony development - mirrors,
					turbine housings, radiator units. A while later the pipes,
					turbine blades, and generators can also be made there.
					Production of efficient working units made entirely locally
					seems feasible sooner than the same goal for solar panels or
					nuclear plants, especially if early units work
					at lower temperatures.

				<h3>Nuclear Reactors</h3>
				<p>
					We'll come back to nuclear reactor designs in the Transportation
					section below, but there is a link in the sidebar to a very good
					overview of the matter, in power-point format. The current
					model Moonwards has for a nuclear plant on the
					lunar surface is quite crude. Expanding it into a
					good representation of a working reactor in space would be great
					for educational purposes. That is a goal for all the models of
					course, but as nuclear generators are so very misunderstood it
					is especially appealing to make that model. (Alas, i don't know
					how to interpret and adapt the drawings i've found of such
					things very well. When i work next work on it i'll seek consultations
					on the matter.)

				<h1>Extraction: Mining and Refining Elements and Compounds</h1>
				<p>
					The Moon has a marked tendency to either have lots of something, or
					none at all of something. Once we are able to really dig around there
					is reason to hope we will find some stuff there is no sign of on the
					surface. For the first years, it is prudent to assume what you have to
					work with is only what has been proven to be there.
				</p>
				<p>
					That list is adequate for a lot of things, but some ingenuity will be
					required to turn it into all we need for survival. Every
					way we process ore must be reinvented to suit the Moon.
					The chemicals most used in batch reactions to refine out certain products -
					acids and bases - are entirely absent from the Moon. If water and other
					volatiles were extracted from the poles in sufficient quantity, some
					of those chemicals could be made. That will take time and the resulting
					resources will be precious for much longer. The more water
					and nitrogen and carbon chemicals you use in materials processing,
					the less you have for farming and living spaces. It will likely be a
					long time before volatile mining can satisfy all local demands.
					Chemical catalysts can be imported from
					Earth and carefully recycled, but a bit will be lost in each batch and
					more will need to be imported regularly. Ways to use plentiful local
					resources to reduce reliance on these chemicals are important.

					Then there is the question of how you get the stuff out of the
					ground in the first place. The powder on the surface that can simply
					be scooped up is good enough for many things, with the designs
					adapted for that shown in these sections, including the dust roasters,
					MIP stations, and the collectors skimming the vapors off the TESS
					reservoir. For purer minerals, at Lalande Crater there
					is a wealth of rocks exposed on
					the surface, with a variety of compositions. Some
					are chunks of the bedrock that was blasted sky high during the
					impact that created Lalande. There are enough such rocks to supply
					reactors with good feedstock for quite some time, you just have to map and
					catalogue what kinds there are and haul the good ones a few kilometers to the
					refineries. But Peary Crater doesn't seem to have many rocks, as it is
					a far older part of the Moon. In such places fine-grain regolith has
					long since buried larger rock chunks, leaving them many meters under the
					surface. And anyways, there are more immediate reasons why you will want
					to make big, deep, steep-walled holes on the Moon than simply for
					mining. That's where you
					are going to put your habitats.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the first 20 cm or so of powdery regolith (8 inches), the ground
					quickly becomes very hard packed. The individual particles of the soil
					look like shrapnel, because that is basically what they are - blast
					debris. Some of them are glass globules because they were from ground
					close enough to an impacting asteroid to be melted by it, and
					the molten spray of droplets cooled solid before they hit the ground,
					but it's
					largely shrapnel. That seems to be why the stuff clumps so well, it
					is all sort of gnarled together. So breaking it up isn't easy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Low gravity is another issue. If you could teleport an
					excavator to the Moon and run it, what would happen when you tried to
					dig with it, is it would tip over on its side.
					When everything weighs one-sixth
					as much, the force of the arm pushing the bucket into the ground is
					enough to lift the body. Just like with refining, excavation has to
					be done very differently.

				<h3>Refining to get metals, oxygen, and metal oxides</h3>
				<p>
					The alternative to using chemicals for refining processes is using
					energy. It takes a lot of it and comes with challenges of its own.
					This is the approach taken by the dust roaster shown
					in the next section. This one
					device can do a lot. It produces a range of
					pure metals, pure oxygen, slag that makes good refractory materials,
					and a vapor byproduct that can be applied as a hard coating and sealant on
					objects placed at the machine's outlet. Because any kind of
					uprocessed regolith that is put into a dust roaster comes out as
					100% useful products, it is reasonable to calculate it outcompetes
					batch methods based on chemicals despite using a lot of energy to
					do so. By filling its hopper with extra-hot lava melted in the MIP
					stations or from solar thermal power plants, its power needs can also
					be considerably reduced.
				</p>
				<p>
					What the dust roaster can't provide is pure metal oxides. That is the
					unresolved issue that really hangs in the air. Building big and
					beautiful on the Moon takes a lot of glass, and making glass takes a
					very specific mix of metal oxides. There are a range of formulas for
					different kinds of glass, and they can stand a small amount of
					impurities. None of those formulas are close to the mineral
					composition of anything found on the Moon. Getting from what there is
					to what is needed requires either heating a suitable feedstock so
					hot for so long that most of it evaporates, or using an awuful lot of
					water and chemicals. The consistent, strong sun can easily do the
					heating with simple mirrors or lenses. The challenge is figuring out
					how to control that so specific substances can be collected, and
					the infrastructure can handle the heat.

				<h3>Excavation</h3>
				<p>
					Provisionally, the excavation for the habitats is planned to be
					done by blasting, just a teeny bit. The kind of blasting done in
					quarries on Earth wouldn't be safe unless all your machinery was
					moved quite a distance away. It would leave a lot of dust
					and debris to be cleaned up too. Since dust on moving parts is a serious
					problem on the Moon, you want to avoid anything that might lead to that.
					Instead, the idea is to bore holes into the ground with a sun gun,
					and place micro-charges of explosive that would be just enough to
					loosen the soil without throwing anything into the non-existent air.
				</p>
				<p>
					It would take experimentation to find the depth and explosive energy
					needed for the right result. To give the soil somewhere to expand into,
					a trench needs to be dug around the grid of boreholes.
					That way the energy of the blasts can be released as movement to the
					the side as well as movement upwards and compaction, resulting in
					loose soil.
					Boring by melting the ground with the sun is important. A
					conventional drill would heat up so fast in the vacuum and
					high-friction soil it would seize in no time. If that was
					overcome, there
					is an excellent chance dust would get into the moving parts and break
					them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once the soil is broken up, a gantry crane like the one shown in
					the Construction section is used to clear the debris. To go deeper,
					a new trench is dug (or rather, mostly melted) and the process is
					repeated. If you reach bedrock, hopefully it will be composed
					of a useful mineral, or a strata not far down will be.
				<br><br>
					Boring and trenching becomes a different challenge at
					that point. Heat diffuses through solid rock many times faster than
					through the regolith. The sun gun won't be very effective any more.
					Quite possibly the thing to do then would be to clear the
					regolith from a large section of bedrock, cover the area well
					enough to fill the space with a very thin atmosphere, and
					switch to conventional drills and saws.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you need to do conventional digging, the machine will need to
					borrow mass from elsewhere by either being anchored to a cable set in
					something suitably immovable, or being loaded with ballast.

				<h1>Transport</h1>
				<p>
					About 3/5 of the velocity needed to get to the Moon has to be
					acquired just to get to orbit around Earth. So, unless you make
					that part cheap and reliable, getting to the Moon is always going to
					be extremely expensive. We are going to do something nifty about
					half way along the current timeline to achieve that - build a tether
					that would actually be practical in Earth orbit. Let us come back
					to that.
				</p>
				<p>
					After you get to Earth orbit, getting safely to the Moon's
					surface involves a speed change of around 6 km/s, which is 21,600 km/h
					or 13,400 mph. The last part of that involves braking from a speed of
					close to 2 km/s (4500 mph) to a speed close enough to zero when you
					reach the lunar surface for a safe landing. Transport in space is a
					really big deal.
				</p>
				<p>
					The plans for the transport system for Moonwards haven't been
					modeled yet, but they have been thought about. That contemplation is
					what first led to the policy of 'politics and budgets be damned,
					we're going to examine what we <strong>could</strong> do in space
					if we tried'. The question of transport is where it is really striking
					how much our capabilities would change if we made a serious commitment.

				<h2>Nuclear Shuttles</h2>
				<p>
					These were mentioned above in the Power section. The kind
					of nuclear ship that could make a big difference, and wouldn't be
					very hard to produce as we already had a working prototype in the 60s,
					is a ship that would be used only in space, preferably beyond Earth
					orbit. Launching a ship like that presents
					<a href="http://space.stackexchange.com/a/16609/4660">absolutely no radiation
					risk</a>. The fuel is not radioactive until you start to burn it, and
					since it is only for use in space, you simply don't turn the engines on until
					you are safely away from Earth. If this was commonly understood half
					a century ago, we'd be living in a completely different world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nuclear ships could attain a specific impulse of 900 to 1000 seconds
					if we rebuilt that 1960s technology. That's a measure of fuel efficiency.
					Another way of saying it is that a nuclear engine could heat its
					fuel so hot it would be moving at 9000 to 10 000 m/s when it exited
					the rocket nozzles. That speed is what determines how hard the
					rocket is pushed in the opposite direction by that exhaust.
					The best chemical rockets have exhaust velocities
					of 4400 m/s in space, so a nuclear engine could speed up or slow
					down a ship by twice as much as the best high-thrust engines we have.
					The virtual colonies use them as shuttles from the lunar surface
					to lunar orbit.

								<h2>Ion Drive Cargo Ships</h3>
								<p>
								Ion egines have now been used to take probes to several asteroids.
								NASA's NEXT ion thruster is rated as having an exhaust velocity of
								nearly 40 000 m/s (I<sub>sp</sub> of 4190 s). They burn their fuel
								only a very little at a time, so they are slow to accelerate
								a ship enough to get it somewhere. In this case,
								that makes them good for getting a cargo ship from low Earth orbit to
								lunar orbit. The mass saved because less fuel is needed means a
								much bigger payload can be delivered. Not as much as the difference
								in I<sub>sp</sub> suggests -
								the mass of solar panels needed to power the drives eats
								a little into payload mass, and the slow, spiraling trajectories
								used by low-thrust motors takes a bit more fuel. But several times
								more than chemical rockets could deliver.
								Ion drives are durable, too,
								so the cargo ship could make the run a bunch of times before it
								needed maintenance.
							</p>
							<p>
								If Neumann drives are successfully developed, that
								would be even better. They look promising if there are no
								issues that show up during on-orbit testing of a working model.
								They might be available
								in a decade or less. Other dark horses include
								Em drives, and Mach drives, but those need a lot more development
								even to be sure they are genuinely viable, and after that a
								lot more development to be working drives.

								<h2>Vertical Tethers for the Win</h2>
				<p>
					The real peach is vertical tethers. Think of them as junior
					space elevators. They hang down towards the surface of the body they
					orbit from a large anchor mass, the same as space elevators do. They
					just aren't attached to its surface. The platform at the bottom of
					their cable	(the foot) instead
					moves above the surface as some suitable low altitude. Ships launched
					from the surface need to catch up to the foot, and to brake to return to
					the surface. The advantage is the delta v required is much less than
					what is needed to get to orbit. For the first tether planned for
					the virtual colonies, it takes 1/5 of the normal delta v. That is
					the case if the foot hangs to 100 km above the surface and the
					anchoring asteroid orbits 5000 km up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Zylon is the material most often considered for this sort of
					application. It is an existing product that is plenty strong
					enough to be the cable for the tether just mentioned. The car that
					runs up and down the cable needs to be designed but that isn't a huge
					challenge. The best cable design, the best way to deploy it, matters
					of control and maintenance and such - these would all need to be
					worked out. They are pretty manageable engineering problems. If
					creation of such a tether was a priority, it is reasonable to expect
					we could have it working in a decade, for the kind of budget needed
					for development of a new rocket.

				<h3>Asteroid Anchors</h3>
				<p>
					To get a good anchor for the tether, an asteroid retrieval mission
					along the lines of the Keck mission architecture
					would be needed. To get something worthwhile, the virtual colony
					version beefs it up by a factor of 10, meaning an asteroid massing about
					5000 metric tons. A nice one full
					of carbon chemicals, pure metals, and hydrated minerals. That one
					goes into a polar orbit. With it, the small initial polar colony
					could go anywhere on the Moon every two weeks, and could lauch to
					Earth that frequently too.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the great things about combining asteroid retrieval with
					tethers, is that it makes mining the asteroid so much easier. Most
					of the delta v needed to get the products to a place where they can
					be used is looked after by the tether. The colony can send machinery
					to do the mining and run it from the surface. As material is
					removed from the asteroid for use in the colony, they can replace the
					mass with lunar material. In fact, they can replace it partly with
					modules and gear they've made for a space station. An asteroid
					mining business and a lunar colony would make great partners.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once an asteroid has been placed in orbit this way, it is a lot
					easier to do the same thing again. The full design for the Moon is
					four tethers in staggered polar orbits and one in equatorial orbit.
					The polar tethers would make any point on the Moon accessible every
					3.5 days, and the equatorial tether could launch to Earth, or
					anywhere else, twice a day. The equatorial tether would be much easier for
					any ship from Earth (or Mars, or the ateroid belt, or anywhere) to
					dock with than the polar tethers, requiring a plane-change of
					a few degrees at most and a much greater range of possible
					trajectories.

				<h3>Tethers as Launchers</h3>
				<p>
					Extend tethers outwards from the anchors, heading
					away from the lunar surface, and they become launchers. Because the
					foot and the tip of the tether orbit the Moon at the speed of the
					asteroid at the center of gravity, and not at the natural orbital
					speed for an object at their altitude. The foot moves far slower
					than orbital speed, and the tip moves much faster. If the
					tether's spaceward cable is 15 000 km long, terminating at an
					altitude of 20 000 km, the outward velocity it imparts to a vessel
					released from there is 2.7 km/s. That's more than enough to return
					to Earth, or go to Mars, Vesta, or Ceres. It will get you most
					of the way to Venus or Jupiter.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you manage to balance the mass
					that leaves the tethers with the mass that is received by them, you
					can even do all this without any use of fuel. The momentum the
					tether complex loses when something leaves is balanced by the
					momentum gained when something arrives. In practice, though, a bunch
					of engines on the anchor masses are needed to keep
					orbits nice and circular and in the right spot. An
					array of clustered ion drives would be enough to achieve this,
					since the asteroid anchor is many times heavier than any ship, and
					the center of gravity of the whole tether can be moved at will by
					reeling the spaceward and moonward tethers in and out. Making the
					platforms at the tip and foot of the tether complex good and
					massive helps with this, and also reduces oscillations by
					increasing the tension on the cables.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is an area where it would be really nice to have those
					Neumann drives. When using magnesium fuel, they get three times the
					I<sub>sp</sub> of the best working ion drives, and the fuel could
					come from the Moon.

				<h3>A Vertical Tether for Earth</h3>
				<p>
					But wait - there's more! That tether in Earth orbit mentioned in
					the intro is the big brother of these tethers. Alright, it isn't a
					space elevator. It would still make a gigantic difference in the ease
					of getting to orbit. And in some ways it's better than a space elevator.
				</p>
				<p>
					A vertical tether whose anchor mass orbits at an altitude of 10 000 km
					with a foot at 250 km has the foot moving relative to the surface at
					4.5 km/s. The minimum speed needed to orbit Earth is 7.8 km/s. The
					speed needed to meet the foot of the tether is 43% less. The same
					fuel as before would be needed to overcome drag, so the overall fuel
					savings to meet the tether foot would be more like a third. Since a
					rocket launching from Earth is at least 80% fuel, that third is a
					really big deal. Now making a reusable rocket is easy. There is so
					much leeway to beef up the structure of the rocket, the result would
					be a rocket that could be safely used hundreds of times with minimal
					maintenance and repair between flights, and the payload it could
					carry would still be several times more than what is possible today.
				</p>
				<p>
					By developing tethers first for lunar orbit, where the demands are
					much lower and the consequence of total failure is limited to the
					loss of the equipment, a path to building the tether in Earth orbit
					is created. The technology is perfected and proven at the Moon
					before the venture is undertaken.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Zylon is still good enough to do
					the job, although it takes an awful lot more of it. The tether
					needs to be at least 10 times thicker where it attaches to the
					anchor than it is at the foot in order to safely bear the loads on it.
					For a decent safety margin, more like 15 times as thick.
				</li>
				<li>The anchor mass
					is just outside the inner Van Allen Belt, meaning the car travelling
					the tether has to traverse it to get there. To safely transport
					people it would need thick and heavy shielding.
				</li>
				<li>
					Powering the car
					is much more demanding than on the Moon. A nuclear power plant like
					nuclear submarines will be the solution used on Moonwards.
				</li>
				<li>
					Earth orbit is crowded. The trajectories of everything up there would
					need to be much better tracked in order to anticipate collisions with
					the tether complex. It would need to be able to take steps to evade
					things, and to move things that are getting too close. Repair and
					maintenance on the cable would be a continuous task far more
					demanding than such jobs on a lunar tether. It would be important,
					and logical, that the space station at the anchor host an
					extensive repair and maintenance service for satellites. It needs
					to be just to protect itself from collisions with space junk.
				</li>
			</ul>
				<p>
					It's a much
					bigger project to build this thing than to do the same thing at the
					Moon. There sure is a huge payoff, though. The tether orbiting the
					Earth appears on the Moonwards timeline far enough down the road for
					it to be justified to assume stronger materials have been found by that
					time. This doesn't require the idealized carbon nanotube cables
					dreamed of in space elevator projects, but cables of less perfect
					carbon nanotubes or graphene would help so much they are being taken
					as existing - something that reduces the taper ratio to, say, 3
					instead of 10.
