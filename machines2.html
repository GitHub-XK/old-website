				<h1>Power Infrastructure</h1>
				<p>
					Unless you go back to plans from the 70s, reference to
					nuclear power has completely disappeared from proposals
					for the Moon. This is unfortunate, as nuclear power is
					constant day and night, small modular plants are extremely
					simple to deploy, and safety is quite easy. At the poles,
					sunlight is nearly constant on certain mountain peaks,
					making solar power a good alternative to nuclear.
					Anywhere else,
					to set up a settlement you need nuclear power. Nuclear is
					a really good idea on the Moon. Here, it is used while
					the initial colony at Lalande, Cernan's Promise, gets
					going.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later on, once Cernan's Promise has developed the
					infrastructure, it can start extracting thorium from
					minerals in and around the crater and produce nuclear
					fuel on-site instead of importing it from Earth. But
					that wouldn't really be for power plants - it would be
					for nuclear rockets. Unless technology like Mach drives
					manages to produce high-thrust engines based on completely
					new science, nuclear engines will continue to be the
					best transport option between the surface of a celestial
					body and orbit. (Unless you've managed to build a space
					elevator... and not if the body has an atmosphere and
					someone lives there... there are a few wrinkles.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The main power source once Lalande has a genuine town,
					and later for the city, isn't nuclear or solar panels.
					It's turbines running on stored solar heat. Specifically,
					closed Brayton cycle turbines using a gaseos working fluid,
 					heated by a mass of molten
					regolith, which in turn is heated by tubes filled with
					molten salts that circulate through a trough of
					parabolic mirrors. These are being called the Thermal
					Energy Storage Systems - the TESS.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reservoirs of molten regolith these systems produce
					are useful. Important volatiles such as
					oxides of potassium, phosphate, and sodium boil off
					them and are collected. If operated
					at a high enough temperature, vapors of pure oxygen
					could also be collected. The systems are sized to have extra
					capacity so that some of the lava produced can be drawn
					off for use elsewhere - such as to supply the dust roasters,
					or as pre-processed feedstock for reactors making glass. The
					heat reservoir would thus need to be resupplied with fresh
					regolith as its contents are drawn off or boil off. Any
					regolith will do, so it can function as a giant cauldron
					contantly stewing a regolith soup. By adjusting the
					minerology of the ingredients and how long the contents are
					left to boil, the chemistry of the lava can be tuned to best
					serve the needs of the furnaces and reactors
					that later use it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the components for TESS units are simple and can
					be produced on-site early in colony development - mirrors,
					turbine housings, radiator units. A while later the pipes,
					turbine blades, and generators can also be made there.
					Production of efficient working units made entirely locally
					seems feasible sooner than the same goal for solar panels or
					nuclear plants, especially if early units work
					at lower temperatures.
				</p>

			<div class="innerDiv">
				<p>
					We'll come back to nuclear reactor designs in the Transportation
					section below, but there is a link in the sidebar to a very good
					overview of the matter, in power-point format. The current
					model Moonwards has for a nuclear plant on the
					lunar surface is quite crude. Expanding it into a
					good representation of a working reactor in space would be great
					for educational purposes. That is a goal for all the models of
					course, but as nuclear generators are so very misunderstood it
					is especially appealing to make that model. (Alas, i don't know
					how to interpret and adapt the drawings i've found of such
					things very well. When i work next work on it i'll seek consultations
					on the matter.)
				</p>
				<p>
					On slide 35 is a great comparison: "Standing next to a
					NTP [Nuclear Thermal Propulsion] engine before launch
					for one year is less radiation than a diagnostic x-ray".

				<h1>Extraction: Mining and Refining Elements and Compounds</h1>
				<p>
					The Moon has a marked tendency to either have lots of something, or
					none at all of something. Once we are able to really dig around there
					is reason to hope we will find some stuff there is no sign of on the
					surface. For the first years, it is prudent to assume what you have to
					work with is only what has been proven to be there.
				</p>
				<p>
					That list is adequate for a lot of things, but some ingenuity will be
					required to turn it into all we need for survival. Every
					way we process ore must be reinvented to suit the Moon.
					The chemicals most used in batch reactions to refine out certain products -
					acids and bases - are entirely absent from the Moon. If water and other
					volatiles were extracted from the poles in sufficient quantity, some
					of those chemicals could be made. That will take time and the resulting
					resources will be precious for much longer. The more water
					and nitrogen and carbon chemicals you use in materials processing,
					the less you have for farming and living spaces. It will likely be a
					long time before volatile mining can satisfy all local demands.
					Chemical catalysts can be imported from
					Earth and carefully recycled, but a bit will be lost in each batch and
					more will need to be imported regularly. Ways to use plentiful local
					resources to reduce reliance on these chemicals are important.
				</p>
				<p>
					The alternative to using chemicals for refining processes is using
					energy. It takes a lot of it and comes with challenges of its own.
					This is the approach taken by the dust roaster shown
					in the next section. This one
					device can do a lot. It produces a range of
					pure metals, pure oxygen, slag that makes good refractory materials,
					and a vapor byproduct that can be applied as a hard coating and sealant on
					objects placed at the machine's outlet. Because any kind of
					uprocessed regolith that is put into a dust roaster comes out as
					100% useful products, it is reasonable to calculate it outcompetes
					batch methods based on chemicals despite using a lot of energy to
					do so. By filling its hopper with extra-hot lava melted in the MIP
					stations or from solar thermal power plants, its power needs can also
					be considerably reduced.
				</p>
				<p>
					What the dust roaster can't provide is pure metal oxides. That is the
					unresolved issue that really hangs in the air. Building big and
					beautiful on the Moon takes a lot of glass, and making glass takes a
					very specific mix of metal oxides. There are a range of formulas for
					different kinds of glass, and they can stand a small amount of
					impurities. None of those formulas are close to the mineral
					composition of anything found on the Moon. Getting from what there is
					to what is needed requires either heating a suitable feedstock so
					hot for so long that most of it evaporates, or using an awuful lot of
					water and chemicals. The consistent, strong sun can easily do the
					heating with simple mirrors or lenses. The challenge is figuring out
					how to control that so specific substances can be collected, and
					the infrastructure can handle the heat.
